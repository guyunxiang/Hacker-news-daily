# Show HN: Created a Nifty Subscription Price and Market Research Generator

**Posted by kmontesdev on 2025-07-04**

Greetings, builders, hackers, and startups. I am a non-technical designer gradually learning the SaaS and developer world. Using AI tools, I build and ship side projects weekly, gaining a lot of valuable experience along the way.

## About the App

My latest project is a smart pricing strategy generator tailored for subscription-based services and products. It also includes built-in market research and competitor analysis features. The app leverages both Claude and OpenAI as available models and uses Firecrawl for scraping pricing pages.

The workflow involves filling out a few forms, which also allow selecting previously generated data to assist the generators.

## Tech Stack

- **Project setup:** Lovable
- **AI integration:** Claude Code for debugging and front-end creation
- **Database and API storage:** Supabase

## Feedback and Future Plans

At this stage, I would greatly appreciate user feedback. Specifically, I want to know if this tool provides enough value to be launched as a micro-SaaS or if itâ€™s just another AI wrapper. Suggestions for improving the app, flow, or content to make it more valuable are also very welcome.

In future updates, I plan to integrate analytics and metrics from Stripe to enrich the data used in the generators.

## Conclusion

Looking forward to hearing your feedback. Thanks in advance!
