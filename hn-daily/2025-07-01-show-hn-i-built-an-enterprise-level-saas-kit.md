## How does this differ from ShipFast?

ShipFast is an excellent tool for getting a simple SaaS to market quickly. LaunchKit AWS, on the other hand, is designed for projects where your market demands more. It is opinionated, feature-rich, and built on a foundation that chooses AWS for its long-term flexibility and power.
