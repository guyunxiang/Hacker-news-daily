# Ask HN: Best Tech Podcasts for Professionals?

**Posted by giantg2 on 2025-07-01**

I'm looking for recommendations for good podcasts tailored to professionals in the tech industry. I'm particularly interested in podcasts that focus on technical skills. 

For example, *The Dark Web Diaries* is an interesting podcast, but I’d like something more technically in-depth. It doesn’t have to be solely security-related—any tech domain works. I just want podcasts that dive deeper into technical topics relevant to tech professionals.
