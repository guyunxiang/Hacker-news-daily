# Show HN: My Open Source HTML Drafting Program

This program addresses the lack of a dedicated open-source HTML drafting tool. Unlike other document types, HTML has no widely available open-source editor tailored for it. I asked myself, "Why not?"

I initially created this project for my own needs. I wanted to build better quality websites without the hassle of editing HTML in a plain text editor, constantly guessing how the code would look once rendered. It’s a frustrating guessing game.

Drawing inspiration from my familiarity with the old text editor VI, I incorporated some of its features into this program. For example, the standard HJKL keys are used for navigation and movement, similar to VI. I also borrowed the idea of using characters as registers, with 'f' used to pull from a register.

Developing such an extensive program was challenging, especially because it works entirely offline within the browser. When I say 'offline,' I mean it has no contact with the outside world—no internet, no external APIs. It was built from scratch using only basic JavaScript.

The biggest challenge wasn’t the language itself, but overcoming the unpredictable nature of browsers. Sometimes, they seem to act as your enemy, blocking or disrupting operations when you least expect it.

ChatGPT suggested I write a more detailed post, as the original was unfortunately revoked—perhaps due to the influx of new users. But I believe this project is a hidden gem. Currently, there’s no GUI menu system; everything is controlled via keyboard and mouse, mainly the keyboard.

Give it a try and see if anything feels familiar. The spacebar offers a quick preview of the final HTML output.

All my bash scripts used for assembling the program are included—making this a pretty complete package.

I wonder who will notice this project first: the online community or the folks down on Yonge Street in North York (Toronto), where I posted physical signs advertising this open-source project.

Is it strange to advertise this way? I’ve put so much effort into writing the code—why stop there? I plan to promote it until everyone knows.

And the best part? It’s completely free, forever.

**Open Source lives on!**
