# Show HN: Circle Crop Photo in 1 Click (No Upload, No Watermark)

**Posted by devxiyang on 2025-08-01**

Hey HN,

I’ve built a simple tool for circle-cropping photos—ideal for avatars, profile pictures, or product thumbnails. The tool, [circlecropphoto.com](https://circlecropphoto.com), works entirely in your browser; your images are never uploaded to a server.

Here's how it works:
- Drag and drop your photo into the tool
- Crop the circle as needed
- Download the resulting image

No login, no watermark, no nonsense.

It's useful for developers, designers, or anyone who needs a quick, hassle-free circular crop. 

Let me know what you think or suggest any features you'd like added!
