# Show HN: I built a tool to save and manage AI prompts on my local device

**Posted by ankit21j on 2025-06-25**

I, like many engineers these days, regularly use Cursor, Claude Code, and ChatGPT. When I come across a prompt that I find useful, I usually save it to my Notion templates, often creating new templates along the way. I know some people suggest using rules in Cursor or MDCs, but for me, that approach quickly becomes bloated.

I love creating CLI tools, and while working on this, I thought it would be a cool idea to build a CLI utility to save and manage prompts locally, keeping my data on my own device. This project resulted in PromptForge.

It might seem somewhat niche or useless to some, but I wanted to share it in case it helps others with their daily workflows.

You can find the public installer here: [PromptForge Releases](https://github.com/aki21j/promptforge-releases/releases/latest)

A guide on how to use it is also available in the same repository.
