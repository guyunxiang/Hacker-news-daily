# Ask HN: Why do LLMs call Trump "former president" despite current knowledge?

**Posted by ahmedfromtunis on 2025-06-27**

I want to clarify that this post is not political.

I've noticed that when I ask Gemini, ChatGPT, Perplexity, and other large language models about current events, they sometimes refer to Donald Trump as the "former president." 

This happens even though these models appear to have access to real-time information about ongoing events. For example, they might say, "Trump ordered the attack on Iran. The former president said..." 

This raises the question: Does this behavior reflect something about how LLMs process information?
