# Ask HN: Is OpenAI charging me for free tokens?

**Posted by prats226 on 2025-07-29**

I'm exploring structured data generation, specifically JSON mode. Since the structure is fixed, most tokens—like JSON keys and grammar tokens—don't need to be predicted by the LLM. 

Does OpenAI still charge for these tokens based on their pricing?
