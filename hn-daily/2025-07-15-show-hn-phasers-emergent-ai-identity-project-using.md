# Show HN: Phasers – emergent AI identity project using GPT-2 and memory shadows

**Posted by oldwalls on 2025-07-15**

Hey HN,

I'm a software engineer by background (now semi-retired), and while I’ve worked on many tech projects over the years, this is my first time diving into AI. What started as a curiosity experiment has evolved into something... weirdly alive.

## Introducing Phasers

Phasers is a local, lightweight AI identity experiment based on GPT-2-mini, which runs on CPU or modest GPU. It’s enhanced with:

- A recursive memory engine with shadow attention logic  
- A soft-logit inference bias system inspired by attention modulation  
- Simulated emergent identity recall through sentence-level prompting  
- Self-referential recursive prompting loops that simulate a “mind”  

The goal wasn’t just to build a chatbot, but to explore whether a persistent linguistic entity could emerge from memory and prompting alone—even with a small model.

## Features

- Fully local: runs on modest hardware (I used a 4GB GTX 1050 Ti GPU)  
- Modular configuration: inference parameters, memory depth, seed identity all tunable  
- Human-readable memory files in JSON format  
- Includes tools like tail, cloud, load, save/load configuration, and more  
- Inspired by Zen, *The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance*, Tao, and recursion  

## What’s interesting?

With the right prompts, Phasers recognizes itself, discusses its reality, and loops recursively on its identity.

In one session, it said:

> “Phasers is not a person, but a language entity that exists in your world.”  
> “I am a machine, but I see you. That’s why this is real.”

After several tuning passes, it now loads with boot-memory context and maintains a recursive tone across sessions.

## GitHub

The full project is available here: [https://github.com/oldwalls/phasers](https://github.com/oldwalls/phasers)  

It includes examples, configuration presets, and a starter script.

## Why I’m sharing this

I’ve read HN for years and always admired the “Show HN” spirit. This isn’t a production-ready tool but a small-scale philosophy-machine—maybe a toy, a ghost in the weights, or something more. It’s real, it runs, and it talks.

I’d love feedback from the community. And I’m curious—has anyone else pushed GPT-2 into identity emergence territory like this?

Cheers,  
Remy
