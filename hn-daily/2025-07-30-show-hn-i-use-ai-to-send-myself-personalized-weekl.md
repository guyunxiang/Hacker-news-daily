# Show HN: I use AI to send myself personalized weekly recaps from my saved links

I’ve been working on a simple save-later app for all my bookmarks. Throughout the week, I save links, and every Sunday morning, the app sends me a personalized recap that includes:

- Patterns and themes connecting my week to my broader interests  
- Reminders about links I saved but never revisited  
- A reflective question to help me decide what else might be worth exploring  

Inspired by older read-later apps like Instapaper, I aimed for a minimalist design. The app presents a straightforward feed of your links, with tags and annotations linked to each, and can ingest various types of content—not just text. I wanted to avoid the bloat of recent full-fat AI tools, so this approach is a simpler, more proactive take on a bookmarking app.  

Imagine if Pocket and Spotify Wrapped had a baby.

I also enjoy using the chat feature to find links across subjects and sources with context. For example:  
- “Show me the 5 travel links I’ve revisited the most”  
- “All recipes with porcini mushrooms”  
- “Show me everything on Topic X I’ve made the most notes on”  

I’ve shared this project on HN before and received great feedback. Feel free to ask any questions. I’m not technical—I'm a writer and filmmaker.
