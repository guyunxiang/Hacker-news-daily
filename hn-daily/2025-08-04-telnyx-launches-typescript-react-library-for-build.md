# Telnyx launches TypeScript/React Library for building custom AI agent widgets

**Posted by maevesentner on 2025-08-04**

Telnyx has released **@telnyx/ai-agent-lib**, a new TypeScript and React library that enables developers to build fully custom frontend widgets for Voice AI Agents operating on Telnyxâ€™s global WebRTC infrastructure.

The SDK provides APIs and React components to manage:

- Audio connection state  
- Real-time transcription  
- Conversation context and memory  
- Agent lifecycle and user messaging  

This gives frontend teams the flexibility to implement multimodal AI workflows with low-latency audio and reliable WebRTC transport.

Additionally, Telnyx has added image upload support to its default widget, which now works with vision-capable large language models like GPT-4o and LLaMA 4 Maverick (via Groq).
