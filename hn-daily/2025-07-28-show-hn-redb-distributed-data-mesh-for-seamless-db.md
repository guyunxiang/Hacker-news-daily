# Show HN: ReDB – Distributed data mesh for seamless DB replication and access

**Posted by tommihip on 2025-07-28**

We just open-sourced reDB: a distributed, policy-driven data mesh that provides real-time access, replication, and migration across various databases—including relational, NoSQL, graph, vector, and more.

It’s designed for AI systems, developers, and operations teams working in complex, multi-database environments.

## Highlights

- Unified schema model across different database types  
- Built-in schema version control  
- Zero-downtime migration and replication  
- Quantum-safe encryption and data obfuscation  
- AI agent integration via the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
