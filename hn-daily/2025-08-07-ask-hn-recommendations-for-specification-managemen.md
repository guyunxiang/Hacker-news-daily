# Ask HN: Recommendations for specification management software?

**Posted by gusmally on 2025-08-07**

Does your team have a spec management system you enjoy using? I’ve used Jira in the past, but I wonder if there’s anything people are buzzing about now.

Every time I create a Linear ticket, fix a bug while writing code, or move the cursor, I feel like I’m touching a specification. I want to give these specs a good home so that we can effectively use them in QA testing.
