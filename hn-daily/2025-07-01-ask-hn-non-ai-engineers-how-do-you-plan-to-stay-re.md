# Ask HN: Non AI engineers, how do you plan to stay relevant?  
**Posted by darth_avocado on 2025-07-01**

Hello, fellow hackers!  

I've been grappling with an existential crisis driven by the rapid advances in AI and what they mean for software engineering careers. As a generalist senior engineer, I've managed to stay adaptable by taking on side projects that cover domains outside my usual scope.  

However, recently, I can't shake the feeling that I'm not moving fast enough. It seems everyone is pushing to replace engineers with AI. If you're not directly working in AI, it feels like you may eventually become unemployed or underemployed.  

I've considered switching entirely to AI roles, but many of these positions require prior experience in the field. Balancing a full-time job while trying to keep up with every new development in AI is increasingly challenging. I find myself feeling anxious, worried that I might get left behind in this rapidly changing landscape.  

Does anyone else share these concerns? If so, how do you stay relevant? How do you manage the balance between work and continuous learning?
