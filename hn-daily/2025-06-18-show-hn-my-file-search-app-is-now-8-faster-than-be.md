## Features

- Added a dynamic caching system for significantly faster and more efficient searches.  
  - Results are approximately 86% faster than version 4.2_3  
  - About 99.43% faster than Windows Search!  
  - Particularly beneficial for large or slow drives, with a trade-off of increased RAM usage.  
  - Delivers performance comparable to tools like Everything while maintaining broad file system compatibility.

## Bug fixes

- Resolved an issue where the application could crash or glitch when the Recents tab tried to display a deleted file.  
- Fixed a bug that caused the app to search all drives when a specific drive was selected for searching.

## Addressing Community Questions and Feedback

Since there were many questions and complaints in the previous post, here are some clarifications:

### Website-related questions or complaints

Some users might experience scaling issues with the website, especially on macOS, iOS, or certain browsers. Keep in mind that I am working solo and optimize the site for the majority. To improve your experience, ensure your browser zoom is at 100% and your monitor scaling is at 100%. 

Regarding mobile appearance issues — I am aware and currently prioritizing app development, so website updates are temporarily paused. Thanks for your understanding!

### Admin privileges questions

Many ask why the app requires admin privileges if it is advertised as portable. The reason is that, without these privileges, the app might be flagged as malware. I don’t have the funds to obtain a signed certificate. Rest assured, admin rights are only needed once during installation, not each time you run the app.

There is also a ZIP version of the app that does not require admin privileges or installation.
