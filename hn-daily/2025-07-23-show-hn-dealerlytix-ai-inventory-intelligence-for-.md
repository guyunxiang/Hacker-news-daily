# Show HN: Dealerlytix: AI Inventory Intelligence for Car Dealerships

**Posted by nubani on 2025-07-23**

I'm excited to introduce Dealerlytix, a SaaS platform designed to help car dealerships make smarter buy and sell decisions using AI.

## The Problem

Dealers often rely on guesswork when deciding which cars to buy, how to price them, and how long they will stay on the lot. Most depend on gut instinct or basic tools that don't leverage their own historical data.

## The Solution

Dealerlytix connects to your inventory data and provides:

- **AI Vehicle Scoring:** Predicts sale speed, profit margin, and optimal pricing before acquiring a unit.
- **Smart Inventory Assistant:** Ask questions like “Which SUVs under $30k sell fastest at my store?”
- **Lifecycle Tracking:** Tracks repricing history, profit snapshots, color trends, and seasonal performance.

We focus on your dealership’s actual performance history, not generic market trends.

## Who it’s for

- Independent dealers
- Auto groups
- High-volume used car operations

If you want to turn your data into smarter decisions—and more profit—Dealerlytix is designed for you.

## Looking for

- Feedback from SaaS founders and developers
- Dealership insiders to pilot the platform
- Sales partners (remote + commission) to help us scale
