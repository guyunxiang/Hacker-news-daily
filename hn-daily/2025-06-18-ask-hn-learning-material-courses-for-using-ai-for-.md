# Ask HN: Learning Material/Courses for Using AI for Coding?

**Posted by askvictor on 2025-06-18**

As a seasoned programmer with established habits and muscle memory, I’m looking to re-train some of those habits to make more effective use of AI. 

I'm seeking suggestions for courses or materials—any format—that people have found useful (or not!). 

Thanks in advance!
