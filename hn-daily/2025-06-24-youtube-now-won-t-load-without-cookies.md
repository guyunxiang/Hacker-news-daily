# YouTube now won't load without cookies

**Posted by nofunsir on 2025-06-24**

It looks like YouTube has finally rolled out its new policy. The website’s UI is completely blank if you don’t allow cookies, regardless of any ad-blockers or other extensions you're using. I’ve been browsing YouTube without cookies for years, but this change seems to enforce cookie acceptance more strictly.
