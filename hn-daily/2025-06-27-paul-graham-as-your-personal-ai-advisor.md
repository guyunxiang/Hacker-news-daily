# Paul Graham as Your Personal AI Advisor

**Posted by vednig on 2025-06-27**

I'm Ved, an "jobless" engineer with a mild allergy to hype and a fondness for well-factored code.

This project is the Paul Graham AI Advisor, trained on over 200 essays—basically YC’s version of Clippy. Instead of helping you improve your résumé, it challenges your ideas, often telling you they're terrible and urging you to launch them anyway. It speaks Lisp, loves growth curves, and will explain why you're not default alive.

This is also part of Resurrect AI, our first prototype that allows you to converse with history’s greatest minds. Finally, you can debate with dead geniuses who can’t block you but will still make you feel stupid.

This is an early build. I’d love your suggestions to improve it—or, if you’re feeling bold, to invest in pushing it further.
