**Posted by amallia on 2025-06-18**

Double-digit speed-ups over naïve K-Means  
Parallel by default (Rayon)  
Includes balanced and spherical variants in one crate  
Memory-efficient for multi-GB datasets  
Builder API that feels ergonomic

Docs are live, the license is Apache-2.0, and the repo is just one command away with `cargo add kentro`. Give it a try — I’m curious to see how it performs in your pipelines!
