# Show HN: Reeyee – Build and publish a website from a customizable dashboard

**Posted by jokera on 2025-07-16**

Hey HN,

I just launched my first solo product: **Reeyee.ai** — a tool that helps anyone create a website by configuring a dashboard with widgets.

I built this in 3.5 months, working solo, and learned a ton along the way. Originally, it started as a personal dashboard tool, but I then realized users don’t just want dashboards — they want websites.

So, I shifted the focus of the product around:

- Creating dashboards with blocks like text, images, charts, videos, embeds, and more
- Instantly publishing that dashboard as a live website
- No coding needed

You can think of it as:

**“Notion-style blocks + drag & drop dashboard + instant website deployment”**

I launched on Product Hunt a few days ago. It didn’t make a huge splash, but that gave me the push to simplify the product and sharpen the messaging.

Would love your feedback! I’m also happy to share more about the technical stack or what I learned from launching solo.
