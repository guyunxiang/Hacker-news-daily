# Show HN: BreathylBox – A lockbox that only opens when you're sober

**Posted by SeanLShort on 2025-07-29**

Hi HN,

I'm an incoming college freshman building BreathylBox—a lockbox that stays locked unless you pass a breathalyzer test and authenticate with a passcode. It’s designed to help prevent access to car keys, firearms, or phones when someone’s been drinking.

Here’s the landing page: [https://www.breathylbox.com](https://www.breathylbox.com)

Right now, we’re validating demand across various use cases:

- Parents storing car keys after parties  
- Gun safety in homes with teens  
- People attempting to reduce tech use while drinking

We’re not selling anything yet—just trying to see if the idea resonates and which use case to prioritize. I’d love your feedback:

- Would you use something like this?  
- What should we do (or avoid) before moving to manufacturing?  
- Are there any obvious legal or hardware red flags?

Thanks in advance — happy to answer any questions!
