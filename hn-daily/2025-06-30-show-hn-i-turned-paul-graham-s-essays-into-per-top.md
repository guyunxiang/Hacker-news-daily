# Show HN: I turned Paul Graham's essays into per-topic navigable knowledge maps

Instead of reading Paul Graham’s essays one by one, you can now explore them through interactive knowledge maps organized by topic.

I’ve always found PG’s essays incredibly valuable, but there’s a problem: they’re scattered across 20+ years and over 200 pieces. For example, you might read *How to Get Startup Ideas* and find it brilliant. Six months later, you come across *Organic Startup Ideas* and realize they’re deeply connected, but you’ve lost track of the specifics—the connections get lost.

To address this, I organized his essential insights into six focused knowledge maps covering the following topics:
- Startup ideas
- Wealth creation
- Great work
- Programming
- Design
- Writing

Each map presents the big picture first, then allows you to drill down into specific concepts and source material.

### Key features:
- Interactive hierarchical maps that illustrate how concepts connect
- AI Q&A to explore ideas and gain insights from the source material
- Clone any collection to edit, annotate, and build upon with your own research; share with friends
- Create your own knowledge maps using PDFs, URLs, or web searches

The goal isn’t to replace reading the original essays but to provide a scaffold for understanding how his ideas fit together. Once you see the landscape, you can dive deeper into the areas that interest you most.

I’d love to get your feedback if you try it!
