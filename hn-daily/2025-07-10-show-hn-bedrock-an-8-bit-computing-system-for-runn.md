# Show HN: Bedrock – An 8-bit Computing System for Running Programs Anywhere

**Posted by benbridle on 2025-07-10**

Hey everyone, this is my latest project.

**Bedrock** is a lightweight program runtime designed to run programs across any computer, console, or handheld device. Programs are assembled into just a few kilobytes of bytecode, making them extremely portable. The runtime itself is tiny and can be built from scratch in just a few hours. Input/output devices such as keyboards, screens, networking, and others can be added as needed.

I created Bedrock to streamline program maintenance for solo developers. It’s deeply inspired by Uxn and PICO-8 but makes significant departures to offer more capabilities to programs and to be easier to implement.

Let me know if you try it out or have any questions.
