## The Origin of Listed

The idea stemmed from frustration. I asked ChatGPT about my own company, and it hallucinated, inventing features and getting basic facts wrong. I realized there was no way for a business to provide a verified source of truth to these models.

This problem is now critical. With Google's AI Overviews and answer engines gaining prominence, your website’s unstructured HTML content is a poor source for the rich, nuanced context that large language models (LLMs) need. Consequently, AI bots from OpenAI, Google, Perplexity, and others scrape your site, often getting it wrong and embedding those errors into their models.

## Why We Built Listed

Our solution: Listed.  
Think of it as Cursor—but for context. Instead of AI helping you write code, our platform helps you build a comprehensive, structured profile of your business that enables LLMs to understand and represent you accurately.

## How Our Agentic System Works

### Automated Context Building  
When you sign up, our agent examines your existing website to generate a first draft of your AI Listing. It structures this data and identifies areas that need improvement.

### Intelligent Workflows  
Based on ongoing analytics, the system initiates simple, chat-based workflows to help you enrich and update your listing, improving both its accuracy and ranking potential.

### Performance Analytics & Feedback Loop  
The agent constantly tracks your AI discoverability and recall accuracy across major models (GPT-4, Claude 3, Gemini, etc.). This data feeds back into the system, generating new tasks to enhance your performance continuously.

## The Connection

Your AI Listing is a hosted service. You add a simple code snippet to your website. When AI crawlers visit, this acts as a signpost—“prompt injecting”—guiding them to your structured, AI-optimized data feed instead of trying to parse your messy site directly.

## Our Mission

Our goal is to give every business an active role in the AI ecosystem. Provide clean, verified data that AI companies desperately need, and in return, you gain control over your narrative and improve your rankings in AI responses.
