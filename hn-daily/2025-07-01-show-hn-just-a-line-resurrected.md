# Show HN: Just a Line: Resurrected

**Posted by hmartin on 2025-07-01**

I always thought Google’s Just a Line experiment was crazy cool and recently wanted to revisit it. However, it hadn’t been updated in 7 years.

So I upgraded all dependencies, including the latest version of Swift 5, added SwiftLint and SwiftFormat, and got it (mostly) working again!

Hope you have some fun with it—contributions are welcome, as there’s still more to do!
