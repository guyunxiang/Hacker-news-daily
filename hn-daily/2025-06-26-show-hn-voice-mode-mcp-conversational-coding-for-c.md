# Show HN: Voice-Mode MCP â€“ Conversational Coding for Claude Code, Gemini CLI

**Posted by mike-bailey on 2025-06-26**

When I heard about Google's clone of Claude Code this morning, I tried it out with my two-week-old MCP server. Instantly, I was able to have a two-way voice conversation with it. Gemini seemed a bit confused by this. :-)

Here's a short demo: [https://youtu.be/HC6BGxjCVnM?feature=shared&t=36](https://youtu.be/HC6BGxjCVnM?feature=shared&t=36)

## About Voice-Mode MCP

It's an open-source (FOSS) MCP server I created a couple of weeks ago. You can find it here:
