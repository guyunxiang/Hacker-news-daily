# Show HN: Qrblox – AI Chat with QR Codes

**Posted by sarahoh on 2025-07-02**

Qrblox is an app that reads the website behind a QR code and allows you to chat with it. QR codes could do more to connect businesses and users, so I’ve added features like a history view, notifications, and feeds to send updates. I’d also like to add callbacks and voice AI to support small businesses.

Roast my app? There are dozens of QR code apps out there. Do you just use the native camera, or do you rely on a dedicated QR code app? Storing local codes for privacy makes sense, but when you want to stay connected, a cloud-based app could be really helpful.
