Telnyx has introduced built-in testing for AI Agents. Users can now create test scenarios with customizable input variables, perform pass/fail checks, and validate their agent's behavior before deploying to production. This feature provides a simple yet powerful way to catch issues early, enabling faster iteration on prompts, logic, and workflows.
