# Show HN: A continuation of IRS Direct File that can be self-hosted

**Posted by elijahwright_ on 2025-06-30**

The IRS recently open-sourced most of the Direct File project, a tax tool they've been developing for several years. Unfortunately, due to recent events, the IRS is no longer actively working on it. I decided to pick up where they left off and am working to get it ready for the next tax season.

The work behind Direct File is very interesting, and I've made much of the documentation available online for review: [https://docs.openfile.tax/en/latest/](https://docs.openfile.tax/en/latest/)
