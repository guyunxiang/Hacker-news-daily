# Show HN: Prpolish, a CLI that uses AI to write and review your GitHub PRs

**Posted by yashg4509 on 2025-06-20**

After getting slammed with 15 comments on my first pull request during an internship, I realized how frustrating it is to write good PRsâ€”especially after hours of debugging and fixing code.

So I built **Prpolish**, a simple CLI tool that helps developers:

- Autogenerate PR titles and descriptions using AI (OpenAI GPT)
- Run "vibe checks" to catch vague commits, missing tests, or low-quality messages before review
- Optionally push your branch and open the PR with GitHub CLI

It supports your own PR templates and is fully open-source. I made it for myself but realized other developers might find it useful too.

Would love feedback or suggestions!

Thanks!
