# Ask HN: Who is doing the best Word/PDF RAG tool with deep research?

**Posted by _samjarman on 2025-07-21**

Hi HN,  

Which SaaS providers are you considering these days for your Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) needs, particularly when working with thousands of PDFs or Word documents? I'm looking for an agent that can take its time, perform well-researched analysis, and provide well-cited answers.  

Thanks in advance!
