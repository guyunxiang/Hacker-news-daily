# Show HN: Tired of fixing broken LLM agents? Automate it

**Posted by yuto_1192 on 2025-07-04**

Hi HN!

Two weeks ago, I launched Kaizen Agent — an open-source tool designed to help you test, debug, and automatically fix LLM agents and applications.

It operates by running evaluations based on YAML-defined inputs and outputs, detecting failures, suggesting fixes, rerunning tests, and even opening a pull request — all with a single CLI command.

### What’s new since launch:
- Improved README with better examples and onboarding
- Now compatible with Mastra, a popular TypeScript agent framework
- Full documentation site launched: [https://kaizen-agent.github.io/kaizen-agent/](https://kaizen-agent.github.io/kaizen-agent/)
- Available on PyPI: `pip install kaizen-agent`

It's still early days, but if you're building production-ready LLM applications and tired of tedious trial and error, I’d love your feedback. Feel free to try it out locally, and if you find it useful, a GitHub star or contribution would mean a lot!

Thanks for checking it out!
