# Ask HN: Is there any LLM provider that is GDPR compliant?  
**Posted by pera on 2025-07-28**

I'm looking for an LLM provider capable of handling:

- Erasure requests  
- Subject access requests  
- Data rectification requests

To be clear, I want a provider that can fully comply with these legal obligations and process these requests accordingly.

From my current understanding, none of the major providers (Google, Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.) are fully GDPR compliant in this regard.
