**Posted by segev_s on 2025-08-07**

Meet Dory — a quick way to cycle through apps on macOS without moving your hand from the mouse or keyboard, and without needing to remember any shortcuts.

### How it works:
- Click your middle mouse button, or press the right Command key if both hands are on the keyboard.
- Type the first letter of the app’s name to find it.
- You can search for apps using the first letter, middle letters, acronyms, or similar names.
- If multiple apps share the same initial, keep tapping that letter to cycle through them.
- Alternatively, press the middle mouse button and start typing the app’s name directly.

### Additional features:
- Prefer tapping over holding? Use **Press Mode** to open Dory’s sleek UI with a global shortcut.
- Dory works immediately out of the box and learns which apps you use most, prioritizing them over time.
- No extra shortcuts or setup needed — just install and start using.

### Pricing:
- Currently available for $9.99 on the App Store
- One-time purchase — no subscription required.
