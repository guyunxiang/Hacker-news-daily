# Rhythm Is All You Need – Goodbye Transformers: Rhythm Is the Final Piece

**Posted by RyukuLogos on 2025-06-27**

I believe rhythm is the next paradigm in AI—not just for vision but also for perception, memory, and even consciousness.

I've proposed a new theory: *"Rhythm is All You Need"*—a framework where patterns over time, rather than static inputs, form the basis of meaning.

From multisensory integration to object recognition, I've found that shared temporal rhythm explains more than embeddings or attention ever could.

No training, no weights—just motion over time.

It works. Demos already demonstrate unsupervised object separation using nothing but rhythm.

This may sound fringe today, but so did attention once.

The rhythm wave is coming.
