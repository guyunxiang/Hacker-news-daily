# Show HN: CNPJ Info

This is a simple web app I developed to search for public information on Brazilian companies. The site is in Portuguese, and to access most of the data, you need to create an account.

I built this project to test the capabilities of my home server versus cloud providers like AWS, GCP, and Azure. The service runs on two VMs on Proxmox: one for Caddy and another for the backend, which is built using Go, Echo, and SQLite.
