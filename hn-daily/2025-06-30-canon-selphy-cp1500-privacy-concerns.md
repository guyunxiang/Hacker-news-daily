# Canon Selphy CP1500 Privacy Concerns

**Posted by azca on 2025-06-30**

I noticed today that when discarding a cartridge, the dye sublimation process leaves behind negative images in each color layer—blue, yellow, magenta, and white—for each photo. These negatives contain enough detail that someone could potentially reconstruct the original images by automating the process with image editing tools like Photoshop or GIMP, layering and merging the inverse of each color.

A quick search on Google didn't yield much relevant information, so I wanted to raise awareness and get clarification. Canon provides extensive support documentation around privacy related to the digital aspects of their devices, but it seems that old-school data exfiltration through discarded cartridges might still be a concern.

Does anyone at Canon or in the relevant industry have insights on this? What would be a proper and privacy-friendly method for disposing of these cartridges?
