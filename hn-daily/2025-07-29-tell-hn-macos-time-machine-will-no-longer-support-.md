# Tell HN: macOS Time Machine will no longer support Time Capsules

**Posted by nodesocket on 2025-07-29**

To my shock and anger, I just upgraded to macOS Sequoia 15.6 today, and when I triggered a Time Machine backup, I was greeted with:

> "Future versions of macOS will no longer support Time Capsule disks for Time Machine backups."

What? Why? My 2TB Time Capsule is still working fine. What could possibly be the justification for this change?
