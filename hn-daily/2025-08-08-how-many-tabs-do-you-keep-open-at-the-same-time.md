# How many tabs do you keep open at the same time?

**Posted by Toby1VC on 2025-08-08**

Currently, I have 42 tabs open, of which only 36 are loaded. Sometimes, I can have hundreds of tabs open. Some users of my Grasshopper extension [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/grasshopper-urls/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/grasshopper-urls/) work with thousands of tabs.
