# Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 DNS server seems to be down

**Posted by WeaselsWin on 2025-07-14**

It appears that the Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 DNS server is currently unreachable. I can't get any DNS queries to go through, and it doesn't respond to pings. Additionally, the homepage at [https://1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1) is also down.
