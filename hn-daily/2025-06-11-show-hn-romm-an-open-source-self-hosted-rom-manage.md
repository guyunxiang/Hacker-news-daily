# Show HN: RomM – An open-source, self-hosted ROM manager and player

**Posted by gassi on 2025-06-11**

RomM is a self-hosted application that enables you to manage your retro game files (ROMs) and play them directly in your browser.

Think of it as Plex or Jellyfin for your ROM library. It automatically fetches metadata, artwork, and game information from online sources, turning your folders into a browsable, organized collection.

You can play games for consoles like N64, Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, and PlayStation 1 right in the browser, using the integrated web emulator powered by [emulatorjs.org](https://emulatorjs.org/).

The community has developed integrations for platforms such as Playnite (Windows), muOS (Anbernic handhelds), and Decky Loader (Steam Deck), with more on the way.

The RomM team has been working on this project for just over two years. They’re proud of what they’ve built — there’s no company behind it, just a group of friends creating something they've wanted for a long time. The project is open-source and licensed under the AGPLv3.
