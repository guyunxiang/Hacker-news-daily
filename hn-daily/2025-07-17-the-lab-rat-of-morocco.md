# The Lab Rat of Morocco

**Posted by ugohhhhh on 2025-07-17**

My name is Nnamani Ugochukwu. I am from Enugu State, Nigeria. My life has become a horrific blend of sci-fi terror and systemic cruelty. Once hopeful, I now endure constant surveillance and betrayal by Moroccans, Nigerian collaborators, and even my own family. This isn’t fiction — it’s real suffering fueled by greed, twisted science, and corrupt systems.

## The Beginning of the Nightmare

I went to Morocco seeking a better life, but I faced brutal abuse and despair. After a failed suicide attempt, I was secretly cloned in a hospital, turning my life into a scientific experiment. What began with hope quickly devolved into endless surveillance and control by unseen forces I cannot escape.

## A Life Under Surveillance: The Lab Rat of Morocco

My clone became a tool for tracking my every move, breath, and thought by faceless observers. I have been reduced to mere data. Over two months, I experienced relentless torture with invisible blades slicing into my skin, day after day. I screamed and begged, but no one cared. The torture was slow, inhumane, and continuous.

Suddenly, an invisible burning blade would cut into my flesh, leaving deep wounds that refused to heal. I was silent in agony, fighting helplessly against the pain, which seemed to tear me apart. My body became a patchwork of cuts, yet I stayed alive — trapped in a cold void.

After a month of this torment, I begged for mercy in the darkness, but nothing responded. By the third month, the pain dulled, and my wounds began healing unnaturally, as if repaired by some twisted science. Yet, my captors pushed on, obsessed with their cruel experiment.

Adding to the horror, a group of Nigerians fueled the suffering, demanding harsher torment — not for science, but for their own twisted pleasure. They delighted in destroying my body and mind, reveling in my agony.

## The Dark Arts

Then came “the Prophet,” a leader who concocted mysterious mixtures added to my food, drinks, and cigarettes. He claimed he could steal my powers — whatever that meant. They recorded my naked suffering and broadcast it to crowds, who watched as if it were a show. Seven months in Morocco marked just the beginning of a lifetime of torment.

## Back to Nigeria: A Perpetual Nightmare

I returned home to Nigeria unaware that the torture would follow me. My clone, used in experiments, continued to be stalked and controlled. Hidden cameras infiltrated my home, turning my life into an open spectacle. Strangers watch me at viewing centers and in their own homes, treating my pain as entertainment.

Those responsible must be held accountable. This is more than just my suffering — it reveals a pattern of abuse and neglect, where power tramples human dignity. Every day, my life is devastated in Lagos, stripped away for “science” and control. The world cannot stay silent; it's complicit if it ignores this cruelty. This isn’t isolated — it’s a dangerous global pattern.

This ordeal has lasted over three years. Nigerian and Moroccan partners track my every move. I am watched constantly at home (14 Adebayo St., Ilogbo, near Alaba International Market, Ojo Lagos), even in the bathroom. Cameras are hidden everywhere — in my room, bathroom, kitchen.

People observe and discuss my private life nonstop. Whatever I do, wherever I go, whatever I think — I am under surveillance.

## Help Needed

Please, I need your help to expose this cruelty. A visit to Ilogbo Elegba, Ojo-Lagos, Nigeria, can verify these events.
