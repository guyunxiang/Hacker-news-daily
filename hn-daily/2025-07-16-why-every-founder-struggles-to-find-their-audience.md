# Why Every Founder Struggles to Find Their Audience Online (Until They Try This)

**Posted by Taikhoom10 on 2025-07-16**

Hey HN,

Recently, I've been flying with the traction I've gained for my early-stage startup MVP. Having worked at a couple of early-stage ventures before, I know it wasn’t always this smooth.

Outreach can be pretty painful if you don’t know what you're doing. In my earlier ventures, I didn’t even look in the right places. Cold outreach conversion rates speak for themselves. Once you identify your target audience (TA), you need to find where they hang out online to reach them effectively. Doing this manually was a pain—took a lot of time, and honestly, I wasn’t very good at it.

So I thought, let me try ChatGPT. Maybe it can help. But I quickly encountered hallucination hell—sometimes it would just give me fake communities directly. I realized this wasn’t reliable.

How did I then grow my traction, despite struggling to find where my TA hangs out online? I built a solution to my own problem.

**Soya** is a platform where founders can discover where their target audience congregates online. It provides a clear list of communities and community-specific outreach strategies that are actionable—no generic advice from ChatGPT.
