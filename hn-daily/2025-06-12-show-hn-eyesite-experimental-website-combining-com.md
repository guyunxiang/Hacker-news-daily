# Show HN: Eyesite – Experimental Website Combining Computer Vision and Web Design

**Posted by akchro on 2025-06-12**

I wanted an Apple Vision Pro, but I don’t have $3,500 sitting in my back pocket. So, I made a version of Apple Vision Pro at home.

This was just a fun little project. Currently, the website doesn’t work on screens smaller than 1200x728 (sorry mobile users!) and may struggle on lower-end devices.

For the best experience, use a webcam pointing directly at you. I tested my site with a MacBook camera.

Any comments, questions, or suggestions are greatly appreciated!
