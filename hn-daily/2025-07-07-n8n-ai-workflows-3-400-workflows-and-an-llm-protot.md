# N8n AI Workflows – 3,400 Workflows and an LLM Prototype

**Posted by sayedev on 2025-07-07**

I've been working on Ultimate n8n AI Workflows, an open-source library featuring over 3,000 AI-powered workflows for n8n. These cover use cases like chatbots, data extraction, and automated pipelines. The goal is to make automation accessible and scalable for developers and businesses alike.

Additionally, I'm experimenting with a private large language model (LLM) prototype that generates n8n workflows from text prompts, using the library as its knowledge base. It's still early days—currently addressing JSON output issues and node logic—but my goal is to simplify workflow creation with AI.

I’d love feedback, workflow ideas, or contributions to improve this project! What automation tasks would you like AI to handle in n8n?
