# Show HN: Talanoa – An email client that thinks like you (now with multi-account)

**Posted by bettercalljohn on 2025-07-28**

Hi HN,

A few months ago, I shared Talanoa here — my attempt to rethink the inbox around people, not threads or timelines. The feedback was amazing and really helped shape the next steps.

Today, I’m back with a big update: multi-account support is now live.

You can now connect multiple Gmail and Outlook inboxes in one interface — no more switching tabs or losing context across accounts.

For those who missed the first post: I’m a full-stack indie developer frustrated with the traditional inbox. I didn’t want another "Inbox Zero" tool — I wanted something more human. Conversations, not chaos. Threads grouped by people, not just by time. A clear view of who I need to respond to, and nothing more.

Since launch, I’ve onboarded early users one by one, watched how they use it, and kept improving. Multi-account was the most requested feature — and honestly, something I needed myself too.

Talanoa remains a lightweight, local-first desktop app built with Electron and Vue. There are no servers or backends—just your data and your inbox. It works offline, boots quickly, and doesn’t try to be clever with AI (yet). Privacy and simplicity come first.

This journey has been incredibly fun and humbling. If you use multiple inboxes and want to explore a different way of working through email, give Talanoa a try. I’d love to hear your thoughts and feedback.

Thanks again,  
John
