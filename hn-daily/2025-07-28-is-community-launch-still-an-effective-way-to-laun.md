# Is Community Launch Still an Effective Way to Launch a B2C Startup?

**Posted by igwepraiseceo on 2025-07-28**

I'm curious. I've heard about different types of launches, but everything I’ve tried so far hasn't been fruitful. Even the one that should have been the most effective—the community launch—seems to fall flat. Admins and moderators of groups and communities often won't allow you to even casually discuss what you’ve built for the benefit of the community members.  

What about "hand-recruiting"? It seems like it’s not a viable option for B2C. Am I right? Cold messages on Twitter/X and other platforms often go unnoticed or are ignored.  

So, what do you think is the best approach to launching a B2C product?  

I’ll be reading all your comments. Thanks.
