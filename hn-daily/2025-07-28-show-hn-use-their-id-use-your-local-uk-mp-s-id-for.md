# Show HN: Use Their ID – Use Your Local UK MP's ID for the Online Safety Act

**Posted by timje1 on 2025-07-28**

Hi HN — 

I built a site that takes a UK postcode, retrieves the local MP's information, and then generates an AI mockup of what their ID might look like.

It's a small, silly protest against the absurdity of the Online Safety Act that just came into force.

*Note:* My OpenAI credits got overwhelmed, so please use a known postcode (for example, one from Kier Starmer's constituency: WC2B 6NH) in the meantime.
