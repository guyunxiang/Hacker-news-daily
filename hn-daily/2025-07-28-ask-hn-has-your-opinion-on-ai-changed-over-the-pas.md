# Ask HN: Has your opinion on AI changed over the past year?

**Posted by atleastoptimal on 2025-07-28**

I'm curious if your perspective on AI has shifted over the last year. Were you initially optimistic but now pessimistic? Or vice versa? Did you once see AI as a major boost to your work but now find it a hindrance? Alternatively, were you dismissive of AI before but now consider it indispensable?

Iâ€™d love to hear what prompted any change in your outlook.
