# Show HN: Aitherapy – 24/7 AI Therapy with HIPAA-Compliant Privacy

**Posted by ali_aitherapy on 2025-06-19**

We built Aitherapy to make mental health support more accessible. It's a 24/7 AI chatbot trained in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), designed to help people cope with anxiety, stress, and burnout—especially when real therapy isn't available.

## What makes Aitherapy different:
- No waitlists, no appointments
- Private and secure: we adhere to HIPAA-compliant data practices, which include encrypted messages, no third-party tracking, and no ads
- 20 free messages daily

I’d love feedback from the HN community, particularly on user experience, privacy concerns, and how we can build more trust in AI-based therapy.
