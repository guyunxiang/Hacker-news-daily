# AI that answers questions without making you hate the internet

**Posted by Liemar on 2025-06-30**

I wanted to ask Google how to stop overthinking. Instead, I was met with SEO clickbait, Pinterest affirmations, and a YouTube video of a guy whispering over lo-fi beats.

So, I built Nexix: an emotionally unavailable AI that simply provides you with the answer—no influencers, no ads, no "Top 10 Mindfulness Rituals." Nexix doesn’t care about engagement; it’s focused on logic and vibes only.

I built it while spiraling, and somehow, it works. Roast it or try it—I’m ready for both.
