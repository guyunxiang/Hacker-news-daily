# Key Technological Advance in Neural Interfaces

**Posted by all2 on 2025-07-22**

It occurred to me today while on my way home that the key advancement in neural interfaces will be in the data layer.

In my experience with electronics, I’ve learned that there is a hardware transport layer—the wires through which signals travel—and a software/protocol layer that defines *what* travels on that hardware.

Currently, my understanding of systems like Neuralink is that there is a solid interface capturing input from the brain and providing output back. Behind this interface is a combination of hardware and software that translates and utilizes the brain’s signals. In essence, we shift from one mode of signals and signal transport to another.

What struck me is that a true bionic system won’t merely provide an interface to the existing hardware and software data layers of the human brain. Instead, it will extend the existing layers by introducing new neurons.

You could start by “bit-banging” this approach—running your bionic neural network in software and doing all the signal processing currently performed by the brain. However, the real revolution would be a piece of hardware that simply plugs into the brain and makes an entirely new neural network available on the same electrical network that the brain already operates on.
