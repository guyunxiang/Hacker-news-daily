# Show HN: Procedurally generated 3DGS splats powered by Spark

**Posted by splatmesh on 2025-07-01**

Hello HN!

I'm the creator of this project, which combines the concept of live-edit Shadertoy scenes with the technique of gaussian splatting, also known as 3DGS. The idea is to allow you to write a GLSL function that defines the splats, and see it rendered in real-time.

Your GLSL code isn’t stored anywhere; instead, you can share your creations easily via URL.

P.S. I’m not a Spark developer—I’m just using their rendering engine.
