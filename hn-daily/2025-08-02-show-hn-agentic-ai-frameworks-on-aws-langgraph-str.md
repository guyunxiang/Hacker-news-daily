# Show HN: Agentic AI Frameworks on AWS (LangGraph, Strands, CrewAI, Arize, Mem0)

**Posted by thinkagenticai on 2025-08-02**

We’ve published a set of open-source reference implementations demonstrating how to build production-grade Agentic AI applications on AWS.

## What's in the repo

- Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), memory, and planning workflows using LangGraph and CrewAI
- Strands-based workflows with observability through OpenTelemetry (OTEL) and Arize
- Evaluation methods using LLM-as-judge and analysis of cost/performance regressions
- Built on AWS services such as Bedrock, S3, and Step Functions
