# Ask HN: What's the hardest/most interesting thing you've used AI to code?

**Posted by ozb on 2025-06-28**

I'm more interested in technically complex projects and systems programming than web apps, "vibe coding" tools, or MCPs.

What tools have you used? What tips do you have?

For me, this includes a few fuse filesystems, inter-language bridges, ORM adapters, a good chunk of app/framework code, and many small platform scripts that I probably wouldn't have bothered with if I had to look everything up manually instead of using AI. Notably, I've used a lot of Rust, even though I don't actually know Rust well.

I make sure to understand each block of code, if not every line, and I review tests carefullyâ€”usually in a language I am proficient in. I primarily use aider-chat.

My tips include practicing TDD, employing systematic design-architecture-implementation-troubleshoot cycles, and using multitasking tools like tmux to avoid waiting idly for an LLM response.
