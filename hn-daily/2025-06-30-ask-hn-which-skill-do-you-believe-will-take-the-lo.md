# Ask HN: Which skill do you believe will take the longest to be replaced by AI?  
**Posted by atleastoptimal on 2025-06-30**

There is ongoing debate about whether AI will surpass humans in all economically viable skills (sometimes defined as Artificial General Intelligence, or AGI). Regardless of if or when this will happen, many people have already lost jobs partly due to the rise of AI capabilities, including in writing, document analysis, design, art, and more.

This situation leaves many feeling anxious about their future employment prospects. While some assume physical tasks will take longer to be automated—since developing, verifying, and testing humanoid robots is complex—others believe the writing is on the wall either way. Those who rely on manual or physical skills may find their roles becoming scarce sooner than expected, potentially just a few years after white-collar jobs are affected.

In light of this, which skills or combinations of skills do you believe will remain resistant to AI replacement and keep workers valuable and employed as AI continues its rapid progress?
