# Show HN: I built an app to collect and manage user feedback for startups and dev

**Posted by averadev on 2025-07-30**

Hi HN,

I’ve built Fidbaq, a simple app designed to help startups and developers collect, organize, and prioritize user feedback — so you can build features your users actually want.

## Features:
- Create your own feedback board
- Let users submit ideas, bugs, and suggestions
- Prioritize feedback with user votes
- Turn feedback into a clear product roadmap

If you’re tired of building features nobody needs, give it a try: [https://www.fidbaq.xyz/](https://www.fidbaq.xyz/)

I’d love to hear your thoughts and feedback!
