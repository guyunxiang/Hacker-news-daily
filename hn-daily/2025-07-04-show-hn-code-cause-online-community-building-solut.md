# Show HN: Code Cause – Online community building solutions for the greater good

**Posted by Brysonbw on 2025-07-04**

Wassup everyone,

I've launched an online community and collective called Code Cause.

## Why did you create Code Cause?

I'm a purpose-driven person who strives to do good. I’m far from perfect, but I work tirelessly to spread positivity and make a positive impact in all areas of my life.

With that in mind, I created Code Cause to bring together people who share that same drive — to use technology as a force for good and build solutions that truly serve humanity. I don’t have all the answers or know everything, so this community is for us to come together, share perspectives and ideas, and ask questions to build solutions openly.

## Why an online community?

Initially, in January 2025, I launched Code Cause with features similar to Hacker News — essentially a clone — as an MVP. However, after a few months, I pivoted to focus on building an online community instead.

## Where is the online community and how can one join?

We are currently using a Slack workspace for our community:

## Will it just be an online community?

No. In addition to the Slack community, I’ve created a GitHub organization so we can develop projects together. I also envision and aspire to add the following:

- Build and create local charters worldwide, each addressing region-specific issues  
- Implement additional features to the main web app based on user suggestions

Since this is a community effort, any new features or additions to Code Cause will be developed collaboratively.

In closing, I’d love to hear your thoughts, concerns, or anything else you’d like to share. Much peace and love to my brothers and sisters.
