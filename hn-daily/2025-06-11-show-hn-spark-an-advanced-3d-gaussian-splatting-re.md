# Show HN: Spark, An advanced 3D Gaussian Splatting renderer for Three.js

**Posted by dmarcos on 2025-06-11**

I'm the co-creator and maintainer of [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) and a long-time Web 3D graphics developer.

I'm super excited about new techniques for authoring, rendering, and representing 3D content. Spark is an open-source library designed to make it easy to integrate Gaussian splats into your Three.js scenes. I worked with some friends on this project, and I hope you find it useful.

I'm looking forward to hearing what features or rendering techniques you'd like to see next.
