# Ask HN: Is AI 'context switching' exhausting?  
**Posted by interstice on 2025-06-19**

I've always experienced a distinct struggle when switching between being *in charge* and stepping back. The best analogy I can think of is the difference between a driver and a passenger's awareness of the road.

Using AI for coding has reminded me of this sensation. Switching in and out of “driving” feels more exhausting than being fully engaged in one role. I have a theory that enforcing reduced engagement can have various side effects, regardless of the format.

I'm wondering if anyone else has encountered this feeling. If so, have you found any strategies that successfully address it?
