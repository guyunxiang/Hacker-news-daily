# Ask HN: What is the ultimate secret to growth?

**Posted by ottaborra on 2025-06-25**

I've noticed that if there's any advice that's universally applicable, it’s growth—overarching discipline, motivation, and so forth.  
Plain and simple.

The way to grow is subtle, easy to overlook, and often negligent from afar. But in the long run, it catches up with you.  
I've experienced this firsthand: I used to sweat profusely while ordering food but now can comfortably talk to anyone.  

This transformation didn't happen consciously; it came after a long journey of mistakes, mediocre experiences, and small exchanges I wouldn't have thought mattered.  
Growth seems non-linear, at least from my perspective.  

So, I'm curious — what do you folks believe is the best way to grow?
