# Show HN: ElizaOS 1.0 - Powerful and useful multi-agent framework in Typescript

**Posted by moonmagick on 2025-07-12**

We’ve just released ElizaOS 1.0 this week. Try it yourself: `npx @elizaos/cli start`

ElizaOS is a powerful new kind of agent framework. Over the past year, we've developed a modular, plugin-based runtime that supports real-world use cases in various industries. These include agents performing complex financial tasks with real-time trading, camera and screen vision integration, voice capabilities, and even 2D and 3D game development.

Our project is MIT licensed and has received contributions from over 600 developers on GitHub. We maintain a dedicated in-house team of 10 developers funded through crowdfunding. Many users leverage our agents to bring their existing startups closer to their customers on platforms like Discord, Telegram, Slack, or even via text message and voice through our Twilio plugin.

While ElizaOS is a robust framework for developers, non-coders can also build agents easily. Our graphical user interface supports full agent creation and plugin customization, and the CLI features Claude code-base generation for new plugins. The framework is designed to be highly vibe-code friendly.

ElizaOS is not only focused on creating "useful agents" but also functions as a powerful no-code character framework. Think of it as an open-source alternative to Character.ai, but inherently multi-agent. Your agents can incorporate plugins to interact with the real world—for example, having their own email addresses, acting as full-fledged voice assistants with screen vision, or shell access. (Caution: what could possibly go wrong?)

We support nearly all major inference providers and allow you to bring your own open-source models. If you want to develop agents that seamlessly integrate with your team or community, ElizaOS is a great choice. Plus, the runtime can even run natively in your browser!
