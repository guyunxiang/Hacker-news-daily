# Acquihire offer from another early stage startup ($2M raised, $1M revenue)

**Posted by jhubble on 2025-07-09**

I received an acquihire-like offer from another early-stage startup that has raised $2 million and is generating approximately $1 million in ARR. They are building a similar product but are further along in their growth. They recently signed some big clients, and I would be joining as a co-founder.

What would be a fair equity split in this situation? Iâ€™d appreciate any advice.
