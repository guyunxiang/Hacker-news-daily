# Show HN: Anagnorisis, local data-management with trainable recommendation engine

**Posted by volotat on 2025-06-25**

I'm excited to share my project, Anagnorisis, which I've been developing over the past two years. It's a self-hosted system that functions like a personal, local Google for all your household mediaâ€”music, photos, videos, and notes.

The core idea is to reclaim our data from cloud services and create a recommendation and search system that is 100% private and adapts to your personal tastes. The entire system is built with Python (using Flask, PyTorch, and Transformers) and runs locally on your own machine.

This project started as a personal quest to build a completely local, spiritual successor to Grooveshark's excellent recommendation engine, which I missed. Over time, it has expanded into a broader tool that I use daily.

I believe we need more tools that leverage modern AI capabilities without sacrificing privacy or control over our most personal data. 

I'd love to hear your feedback and thoughts!
