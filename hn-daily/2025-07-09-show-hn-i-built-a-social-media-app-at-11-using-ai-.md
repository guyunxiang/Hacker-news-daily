# Show HN: I built a social media app at 11 using AI and a phone

**Posted by homenetwork on 2025-07-09**

Hi HN, I’m 11 years old and I’m learning to code with the help of AI. Recently, I created my own social media app inspired by TikTok and short videos. I built it from scratch using just my Android phone and some programming apps like Replit and Base44.

The idea is to let users post and watch short videos, follow others, and like videos. I designed the interface and built the logic myself, and AI helped me when I got stuck on bugs or needed help understanding things.

This is my first serious project, and I’d love to get feedback from developers and creators.

What do you think? What should I improve next? Thanks for reading!
