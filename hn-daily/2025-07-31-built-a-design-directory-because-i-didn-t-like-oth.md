## Why I Built This

As a newbie designer, I was looking for resources in existing directories to improve my skills. However, I faced some challenges:

- Search functionality was limited to tool names, preventing me from describing the type of resource I was looking for  
- Many directories had cluttered interfaces  
- Sign-ups and waitlists often wasted my time  
- It was hard to understand what each resource does or whether it’s free
