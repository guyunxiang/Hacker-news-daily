# How to Spot Fake Products on AliExpress

**Posted by FakeFind_ai on 2025-07-19**

If you shop on AliExpress, you've probably come across reviews that feel suspicious—lots of vague 5-star ratings, broken English, or photos that don’t match the product. 

We built FakeFind to help you identify fake or misleading reviews before making a purchase.

## How it works:

1. Copy the AliExpress product link.
2. Paste it into FakeFind.
3. Our AI scans the reviews and provides:

- A **Trust Score** (1–10) indicating review authenticity.
- A quick summary of the review quality.
- Recommended alternatives with more reliable feedback.

FakeFind supports multiple platforms, including Amazon, Walmart, eBay, and AliExpress. It’s free to use—no account or extension required.
