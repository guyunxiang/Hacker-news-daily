# Poll: Interested in joining a "Founders over Fifty" group?

**Posted by sendos on 2025-07-07**

I've been thinking that founders over the age of 50 (including myself) face some unique challenges, have valuable experience, and possess insights that could benefit others. It would be great to create a forum where we can exchange tips, strategies, and information.

We could meet in person or via online video calls. If in person, the San Francisco Bay Area seems like a natural starting point for testing this idea.

If you're a "Maybe," please mention in a comment what might convince you to say "Yes."
