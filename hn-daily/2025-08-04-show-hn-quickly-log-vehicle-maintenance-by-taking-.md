# Show HN: Quickly log vehicle maintenance by taking a photo of your invoice

**Posted by zarqaTech on 2025-08-04**

I’ve built a simple iOS app that allows users to take a picture or screenshot of their mechanic invoice. The app automatically processes and organizes the logs in chronological order within seconds. You can also export all this information via email.

I think this would be useful for someone selling a car to prove all the work done over the years, along with providing images of the invoices that can be easily exported.

The app is called **Vehicle Maintenance Log**. You can check out the landing page [here](https://vehiclemaintenancelogapp.com) for more information. It’s also currently available on the iOS App Store.

Would you use this to back up your vehicle maintenance with screenshots of invoices? I’d love to hear your thoughts!
