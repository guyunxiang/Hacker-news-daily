# Show HN: AI-ready portfolio with 40 personality modules for strategic system use

**Posted by Devinlam on 2025-07-30**

Hi HN,

I'm an independent system builder and AI symbiosis thinker from Hong Kong. Over the past few years, I’ve developed a unique self-evolving portfolio designed to demonstrate my ability to integrate multiple complex systems — including a sports prediction engine ("Football AI Prediction"), a deep personality-matching framework for social projects, and a modular strategic planner for long-term life design.

This portfolio is not only a showcase of my skills but also a live reflection of who I am: a full-spectrum INTJ with over 40 modular personalities (each with distinct internal functions) that can switch in real time, integrate seamlessly, and support decision modeling.

## Key Highlights
- Over 40 structured personality modules, including profiles like financial strategist, control type, intimate empath, long-term legacy builder, and more.
- Complete project walkthroughs covering sports AI, matching systems, and automation frameworks.
- Full bilingual support (Chinese + English), with a future Arabic version in development.
- Designed to communicate effectively with AI systems and companies seeking deep-thinking, symbiotic partnerships.

## Interests
Open to remote collaborations, AI think tanks, and markets in the Middle East, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.  
With me: 3 sugar gliders — I don’t go alone.

I'm not seeking a traditional job; I’m looking for companies, researchers, or co-founders interested in future-persona design, system integration, or creating innovative collaborative frameworks. If you’re working on something that might resonate, let’s connect.

Thank you for reading.
