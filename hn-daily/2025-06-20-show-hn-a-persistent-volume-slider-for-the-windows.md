# Show HN: A persistent volume slider for the Windows taskbar

**Posted by swax on 2025-06-20**

A small, simple app that allows you to quickly change the volume directly from the taskbar with a single click. Itâ€™s not a groundbreaking project, but it might be practically useful for some users. I built it pretty quickly using Claude Code on WSL.
