# Ask HN: Will AI Usage Make Frameworks Last Longer?

Because of how LLMs (Large Language Models) tend to perform best with languages and frameworks they have training data for, there's an interesting question about their impact on the longevity of development frameworks.

Currently, AI models excel at coding in popular languages like JavaScript, PHP, or Python, especially with frameworks such as React and Vue. However, if you move away from these mainstream options, you'll likely need to do significant custom AI training or wait for publicly available models to gather enough data to understand new languages or frameworks effectively.

This limitation is evident with niche languages or specialized setupsâ€”generative AI simply doesn't understand the less common material well enough to be truly useful.

Does this mean companies will stick with existing, well-supported frameworks so they can leverage AI to generate code more easily? Could it even prevent new frameworks and languages from gaining traction, due to the scarcity of training data for AI models?
