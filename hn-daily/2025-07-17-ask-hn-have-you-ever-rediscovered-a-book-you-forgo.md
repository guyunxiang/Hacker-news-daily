# Ask HN: Have You Ever Rediscovered a Book You Forgot You'd Read?  
**Posted by bicepjai on 2025-07-17**

Recently, I was listening to *The Podcast: Google DeepMind*, where Professor Hannah Fry showcased the book *Fermat’s Last Theorem* and discussed it with Gemma 3 VLM. That moment triggered a sense of familiarity—I vaguely remembered the book but couldn’t recall whether I had read it.

Curious, I bought a copy and read it. When I went to update my Goodreads, I discovered it was already marked as read. Suddenly, it all came back: I had read the PDF version a decade ago and couldn’t stop talking about it at that time. It felt surreal to get completely absorbed and elated by the story all over again, as if it was the first time.

**Has this happened to you?**  
Have you ever eagerly started a book, only to realize partway through (or afterwards) that you had already read it years before?  

**If so, which book gave you that sense of deja vu?**  
Did re-reading it bring back memories or spark the same excitement?
