# Ask HN: How do I give back to people helped me when I was young and had nothing?

**Posted by jupiterglimpse on 2025-06-13**

Throughout my career, I’ve received incredible kindness and inspiration from experienced people—professors, and strangers who invested time in me when I felt I had little to offer in return. While I always express gratitude and try to pay it forward, I often feel there’s still an imbalance. I feel like I owe something more direct to the specific people who shaped my life.

How do you meaningfully give back to people who helped you early on—when you literally had nothing, haha? What forms of gratitude have you found most meaningful?

I appreciate any comments.
