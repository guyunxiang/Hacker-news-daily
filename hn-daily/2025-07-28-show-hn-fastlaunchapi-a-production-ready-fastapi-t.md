# Show HN: FastLaunchAPI – A production-ready FastAPI template batteries included

**Posted by niklasdev on 2025-07-28**

Hello HN

After building numerous FastAPI backends, I consistently found myself repeating the same configuration, including authentication, email, payments, migrations, and more. To streamline this process, I developed **FastLaunchAPI**, a production-ready startup package.

### What’s included:

- JWT authentication with social login and email  
- Webhooks and Stripe billing integrated together  
- Alembic, PostgreSQL, and SQLAlchemy setup  
- Background work support for complex tasks  
- SMTP email with templates  
- Integration of LangChain and OpenAI  
- Setup for Pytest and API documentation

FastLaunchAPI is designed to get you to production in less than half an hour and is modular for flexibility.

There is comprehensive documentation available to review before purchase. I’d be happy to hear any comments or inquiries!
