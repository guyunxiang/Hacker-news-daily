# Ask HN: How do you find and sell to B2B customers?  
**Posted by jetprop on 2025-06-26**

My startup is struggling. We've built an impressive product, and our v1 is genuinely good. We followed the YC book and spent almost a year doing almost all manual work while operating as a manual service.

We received some validation and are generating low three-digit revenue, but it's not enough.

I see clear potential for B2B SaaS companies to benefit significantly from our product in their marketing efforts. However, lately, I've been getting mostly lackluster responses or outright NOs.

Pivoting entirely to a different industry won't help us, as we have limited domain knowledge outside our current focus. Our software is designed for marketing and sales teams.

**My main question:**  
How do I convince these teams to try our product and grow our revenue?

I'm also curious about how newer startups, whether YC-backed or others, manage to generate tens of thousands of MRR. It often seems like hype—yet, these companies are selling half-baked products that people still buy.  
Why are customers willing to pay for these solutions when AI tools like Claude or ChatGPT can perform many of the tasks themselves?

Our product v1 is ready, but I’m feeling a bit desperate for more validation and revenue.
