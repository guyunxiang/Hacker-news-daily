# Show HN: Tech docs → video explainers in seconds

**Posted by feliks22 on 2025-07-18**

Symvol transforms any tech document into an AI-narrated video in approximately one minute. Every code block remains interactive, allowing viewers to click to copy and run snippets while watching.

## Why we built it

We started as a generic “text to video lesson” tool. Early testers requested coding support, so we added a code-aware pipeline. This is the first public release of that version.

## Try it

- Drag and drop a PDF at [symvol.io](https://symvol.io) (free to try)  
- Or install our Chrome extension to run Symvol on any web page

## We’re looking for feedback on

1. Narration accuracy  
2. Clarity of visuals  
3. Usefulness of the live copy-and-run feature

We’ll be around all day—happy to answer questions or dive deeper in the comments!
