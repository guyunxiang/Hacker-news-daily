A user shared their recent experience with Twilio:

On July 3, 2025, at 2:04 PM PDT, Twilio Support notified them that their account had been temporarily suspended shortly after they made a $20 payment. 

The message from Twilio explained that the suspension was part of their ongoing security measures to verify the account's intended use. They asked the user to respond with specific information, including:

- Whether they are a developer creating experience for clients or customers.
- The Twilio products they intend to use and a description of their use case.
- If applicable, links to their website, app, or online profiles (such as LinkedIn, GitHub, or social media) to verify their association with their business or brand.

Twilio also directed them to their Trust Center, where they can access a self-service tool for security and connect with a representative via Live Chat if needed.

The support team promised to update the user once they received the response. The user expressed frustration, stating:

> "you shouldn’t have taken my money in the first place if you’re not sure. This is big tech exploitation."

This incident highlights the sometimes opaque and abrupt nature of account suspensions, even shortly after a payment is made.
