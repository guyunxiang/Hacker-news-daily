# People can exploit your social media pictures and so I've made a tool

**Posted by Gravyt1 on 2025-08-04**

For a few weeks now, I've been working on a small website — a simple but useful project that I believe is accessible to everyone. It’s a tool I’ve developed to help better understand how to gain visibility on a project created and bootstrapped by myself.

This site isn’t groundbreaking, and most of the front-end code was generated with lA. Its main goal is to bring together several privacy protection tools, currently focusing on a handy utility for viewing and deleting metadata across many document types.

**Why is this important?**  
Many people are unaware that files shared online often contain sensitive information:

- **Photos:** GPS location, date, device model  
- **Documents:** Author’s name, editing history, comments

Attackers can exploit this data for OSINT (Open Source Intelligence), tracking habits, feeding AI models, or even identity theft.

Unlike other tools, this site does **not** store any files. I aim to make the source code available in the future or possibly develop a front-end-only application. For now, all processing is done server-side with Python Pillow, and files are processed in temporary variables that are cleared immediately after. No backups are kept.

**Future plans include:**  
- Adding a lightweight API  
- Integrating other privacy-related tools  
- Providing educational content

Today, I’m seeking new users to try out my website, as well as contributors. I’ve created a Product Hunt page to gather support — if you like the idea, a small upvote would help a lot! If you'd like to test the site or contribute, everything is open.

Thank you! :)
