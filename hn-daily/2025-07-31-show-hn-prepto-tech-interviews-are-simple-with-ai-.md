# Show HN: Prepto.tech – Interviews are simple with AI (no cheating)

**Posted by gurachek on 2025-07-31**

I've been through 50+ technical interviews as both a candidate and an interviewer. The current system is broken: we memorize algorithms we’ll never use, while real job skills go untested.

Prepto.tech generates interview questions directly from job descriptions using AI. Simply paste a job description, and you'll receive relevant technical questions. Practice with flashcards and deep focus mode. This isn't generic prep—it’s tailored to what they’ll actually ask.

The goal: shift interviews from questions like "Can you reverse a binary tree?" to "Can you build what we need?"
