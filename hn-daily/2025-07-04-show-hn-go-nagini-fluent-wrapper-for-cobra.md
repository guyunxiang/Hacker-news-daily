# Show HN: Go-nagini fluent wrapper for Cobra

**Posted by grubinator on 2025-07-04**

I've created this library to make using Cobra (the popular Go CLI library) more fluent and to better utilize Go generics when registering command flags.

I'd appreciate feedback on the README and whether you find this wrapper useful. Also, let me know if the fluent API reads well.

If all goes as planned, I intend to release version 1 soon! This depends on whether I can implement a missing feature: elegantly defining mutually exclusive flags.
