# Show HN: A protocol for LLM client to render UI components

**Posted by ericlmtn on 2025-07-09**

Much like how servers used to render HTML, LMUI is a protocol that guides LLM apps and clients to render specified UI components.

I'm not sure if anyone has already built an existing protocol, but I really believe that relying solely on plain text limits the potential of LLM clients. With the rise of more interactive MCPs, there's greater opportunity to enhance how we interact with existing services. Improving the UI and UX should be the next step in advancing LLM applications.

PRs and feedback are very welcome.
