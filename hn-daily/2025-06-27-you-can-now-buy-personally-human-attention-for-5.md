# You can now buy personally Human Attention for $5

**Posted by Lovishotherdays on 2025-06-27**

Attention used to be personal property. Now feeds scalp it and resell it by the pixel. I got tired of donating mine, so I built Momentarily.

**What it is:**  
A calendar with 30-second slots.

**Price:**  
$5 flat, paid once.

**What you get:**  
During your slot, I focus only on you or whatever you specify. No phone, no tabs, no idle Spotify.

**What you don’t get:**  
Follow-up emails, analytics, or upsells. When the timer hits 00:30, it’s over.

Call it reverse capitalism. Instead of stealing attention, I sell mine at retail.

**AMA:**  
Performance art, protest, or tiny utility?
