# Ask HN: Will I get sued or acquired for my video translator app?  
**Posted by xucian on 2025-06-18**

Creating a video translator is very personal to me. I want my non-English-speaking parents to finally access the vast sea of knowledge I’ve been fortunate to encounter.

Based on GPT and internet data:
- General language distribution: English ~60%, Chinese ~15%, Spanish ~8%, others ~17%
- Video content: English ~55%, Spanish ~15%, Hindi ~10%, others ~20%

Can you imagine the amount of information non-English speakers miss—up to 55% of the world’s content? The potential of such a tool is immense. I don’t want a generic "video translator" app; I aim for a knowledge homogenizing tool. I’ve tried many options, but most are either too generic or too complex. My goal is a purpose-driven app: I don’t just want to translate videos; I want to help knowledge transcend language barriers.

This scenario is highly relatable. You watch an amazing podcast, documentary, or educational content (like Sapolsky’s *Human Behavioral Biology* or channels like Veritasium and *The Ordinary Things*), and wish your parents—or anyone with limited English—could understand it. My approach tackles this differently. My goal is efficient information transfer.

While not perfect, I would be thrilled if such a tool existed. I am determined to build it if it doesn’t. I’ve searched GPT, Grok, and Google for "video translator," but all I found were either generic multi-purpose AI video services or platforms that attempt to do it all and produce subpar results.

The best I found was 11Labs’ video translation (though HeyGen currently does better and is acceptable). However, these tend to be more studio-oriented. I want a simple, social, quick-turnaround app that does one thing exceptionally well—a lightweight wrapper around existing tools like 11Labs, optimized for seamless UX.

I’ve seen Lex Fridman’s videos translated into Spanish using 11Labs, which looked pretty good—probably with manual editing. I’m not aiming for such perfection, but I want to convey at least 80–90% of the core information with minimal distractions, artifacts, or errors.

Ideally, I’d create a simple mobile app where users can submit a video link (e.g., YouTube or direct link, with rights), and the app processes it in the backend. Once done, it provides a shareable link, allowing viewers to watch the translated version via their preferred app (WhatsApp, email, Telegram, etc.).

Will I get sued or acquired for building this? Or can this be a genuinely valuable, marketable tool?
