# Show HN: I was tired of my mobile projects getting buried – so I built MobDrop

**Posted by lumber_prog on 2025-07-11**

Hey HN,

After watching countless mobile side projects get buried after a single social media post, I built MobDrop — a platform where mobile developers can actually get discovered.

The problem is: Twitter and Instagram posts disappear, GitHub repositories don’t showcase UI/UX well, and general platforms like Dribbble miss the technical side of mobile development. Mobile developers need a dedicated space to build their reputation and get found.

MobDrop is like Dribbble meets Product Hunt, but 100% focused on mobile development — apps, side projects, UI concepts, and prototypes. Finally, a place where your Flutter animations, iOS transitions, and other technical work get the attention they deserve.

### Key features:
- Public developer profiles & project showcase
- Weekly top 3 featured projects (community voted)
- SEO-optimized: projects and profiles get indexed by Google
- Video and image support for demos
- Free during early access
- Gamification and a mobile blog coming soon

I wanted something lightweight and motivating — a place where mobile developers can build a reputation for what they’ve actually built, not just what they talk about.

### I’d love feedback from mobile developers:
1. Would you showcase your side projects here?
2. What features would you like to see on a platform like this?

Thanks for reading! If you're a mobile dev, I’d love to see your work on MobDrop.
