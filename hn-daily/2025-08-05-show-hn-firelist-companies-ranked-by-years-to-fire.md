# Show HN: FireList – Companies Ranked by Years to FIRE

**Posted by rlindskog on 2025-08-05**

Hey HN! I built a small app that allows you to compare companies or job offers based on "years until financial independence" (FIRE) rather than just total compensation. I realized that the same offer from two different companies can have a significant difference in the estimated years to reach FIRE.

The app also provides rankings of companies based on the estimated time to FIRE, using some assumptions. For details on the methodology, see [this page](https://firelist.io/methodology).

It has been useful for me, and I hope it will be helpful for you too! I’ll be adding more benefits and companies over the next few days. Feel free to share any requests or feedback!
