# Open Source and OpenAI's Return

**Posted by ricecat on 2025-08-05**

OpenAI has just launched GPT‑OSS, its first open-weight model family since GPT‑2. The new models include a 120-billion-parameter variant and a 20-billion-parameter variant that users can run locally — even on laptops or high-end desktops. Both models are released under the Apache 2.0 license and perform nearly as well as OpenAI’s previous o3‑mini and o4‑mini models.

This isn't a marketing stunt — it's a significant development. It marks OpenAI’s return to releasing model weights that anyone can inspect, modify, and self-host. This shift came in response to competitors like DeepSeek and Meta releasing truly open-source or open-weight models. In January 2025, DeepSeek launched R1, a fully open and cost-efficient model that quickly outperformed proprietary systems and gained global attention. OpenAI’s move to release GPT‑OSS follows this disruptive trend.
