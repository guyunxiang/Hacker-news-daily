# Show HN: I made a simple rain sounds app to help myself fall asleep

**Posted by dominichuang on 2025-07-17**

I've built a rain sounds app (currently available on iOS and iPadOS) because I used to struggle falling asleep. It actually helped me drift off faster. If you have trouble sleeping too, maybe it can help you as well!

Features:
- Pure rain sounds
- Runs offline and is lightweight
- Smooth rain animations

Now, it’s my daily companion. If you try it out, I’d love to hear what you think!
