# Ask HN: What is the best way to learn 3D modeling for 3D printing?

**Posted by wand3r on 2025-07-15**

I'm looking for a course or series of videos to learn how to create and design objects for 3D printing. For me, this seems very complex. Software like SolidWorks feels even more unintuitive compared to Photoshop, adding an extra dimension to the learning curve. There are many tools, hotkeys, and principles that are difficult to grasp by simply experimenting.

I'd like to find a course that explains how to use modeling software for designing 3D objects. It can be overwhelming when you don't know what you don't know. With so many software options and their respective ecosystems, there are countless buttons, knobs, and concepts to learn.

**TL;DR:** Are there any good video or written courses that help a beginner reach an intermediate level of 3D modeling for 3D printing?

**Specific context:** I own a Bambu PS1 and have a year-long subscription to Coursera.
