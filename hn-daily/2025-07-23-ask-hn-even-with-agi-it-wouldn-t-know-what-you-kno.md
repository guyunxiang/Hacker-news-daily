# Ask HN: Even with AGI, it wouldn't know what you know. Can we preserve that?

**Posted by consumer451 on 2025-07-23**

Even if we had true AGI today, and if that AGI achieved top 0.001% human-level intelligence, it would still not possess your personal experiences and specific knowledge of a project or domain. It could not replace you.

That AGI would lack the direct experience you've accumulated. How could it, without recording all of your audio and visual inputs?

Clearly, I am not the first to consider this idea. My question is: is it important for us to actively resist the inevitable collection of all our audio and visual existence? Or, is resisting this development a Luddite stance in 2025?
