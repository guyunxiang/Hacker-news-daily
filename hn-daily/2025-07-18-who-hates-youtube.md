# Who Hates YouTube?
**Posted by thoth001 on 2025-07-18**

YouTube has become a frustrating experience for many users lately.

The platform feels like it has only one way in, and it’s down. The interface leaves much to be desired.  
Every time you open the app, you're immediately hit with an ad.  
Playing a video triggers two more ads.  
Scrolling to see comments introduces yet another ad.  

They are pushing short-form videos, and now when you search for anything, all you get are these brief clips. If I wanted to watch 30-second videos, I wouldn’t be on YouTube—I’d be on another platform.

Do you agree?  
Leave your comments with what irritates you the most about YouTube, features you'd like to see added, and how you would fix it.
