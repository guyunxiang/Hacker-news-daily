# Ask HN: I am looking for MCP server beta testers

**Posted by willahmad on 2025-07-21**

Hey folks,

I'm currently looking for beta testers for a macOS-only MCP server. If you're interested in the MCP ecosystem, I’d love to hear your feedback.

The app runs entirely locally—your credentials are securely encrypted using your Keychain password, and nothing leaves your machine. It’s still early in development, but your input could help shape its direction.

If you’d like to try it out, please reach out to me at: kzphefll8@mozmail.com

Thanks!
