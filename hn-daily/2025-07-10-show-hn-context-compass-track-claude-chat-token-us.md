# Show HN: Context Compass – Track Claude chat token usage before hitting limit

**Posted by raydawg88 on 2025-07-10**

I built a small Chrome extension for people who write long conversations in Claude and don’t want to unexpectedly hit the 200,000-token limit.

**What it does:**
- Automatically counts words and estimates token usage as you write.
- Updates in real time.
- Displays a visible percentage bar to show your current usage.
- Helps power users manage sprawling chats without losing work or flow.

**Why I built it:**
I kept getting the “max context” error and realized there was no way to track usage in Claude proactively.

**Additional notes:**
- No signups required.
- No tracking of user data.
- Just a simple install.

I'd love any feedback or ideas for improvements. Thanks!
