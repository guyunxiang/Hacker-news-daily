# Show HN: What time is it in Corporate

**Posted by marxism on 2025-06-26**

Three months ago, someone posted a site that displays time in various corporate calendars. The most interesting comment I saw was about the National Retail Federation 4-5-4 calendar, which is quite hard to understand. To clarify, I created a visualization of this calendar.

In addition, I implemented support for other calendar types that people requested. 

I also discovered the SEC dataset containing information on 10,032 publicly traded companies. However, I haven't finished implementing a search feature for company symbols yet.
