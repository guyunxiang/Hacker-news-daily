# I tested a GenAI agent on real cybersecurity scenarios and it surprised me

**Posted by niruwu on 2025-07-02**

I recently came across a platform that lets you spin up custom GenAI agents without writing much code. Out of curiosity, I tried building one for a use case I rarely see discussed outside enterprise tools: quick threat triage for small teams.

The idea was simple. Feed the agent basic logs or threat descriptions and ask it to suggest next steps. Not alerts or dashboards, but contextual follow-ups. For example, asking, "This looks like a port scan, what should I check next?" or "This file was flagged, how can I validate it manually?"

I used Lyzr to test the setup in a controlled environment with mock data. What stood out was not just the accuracy but how the model handled uncertainty. When the input was vague, it asked for clarification. When it lacked enough context, it admitted that instead of making guesses. That felt genuinely new.

Admittedly, it’s not perfect. It struggled with very technical payloads and tended to make conservative assumptions. But for exploratory questions or when narrowing down false positives, it proved surprisingly helpful.

Has anyone else experimented with GenAI in this way? Not to replace analysts, but to make the loop between suspicion and action more efficient.

I believe there’s a lot of unexplored potential in using agents for reasoning rather than just reporting.
