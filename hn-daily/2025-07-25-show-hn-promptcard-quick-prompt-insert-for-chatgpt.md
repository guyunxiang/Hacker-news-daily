# Show HN: PromptCard â€“ Quick prompt insert for ChatGPT web interface

**Posted by JohnnyZhang483 on 2025-07-25**

I often find myself repeatedly inputting similar prompts when using ChatGPT. To improve my workflow, I wanted a faster way to reuse and insert prompts without disrupting my typing flow. Additionally, I wanted a dedicated space to save and manage my frequently used prompts.

So, I built **PromptCard**, a Chrome extension that makes prompt input faster and more comfortable.

## How it works

- In the ChatGPT input box, you can enter a shortcut like `#prompt_shortcut`.
- When you send the message, the extension replaces the shortcut with the full prompt content and sends it to ChatGPT.

## Example

Suppose you want ChatGPT to help draft an email to your boss requesting a day off. You might type:

> "My son has a fever and I need to stay home tomorrow to take care of him. Please help me write a short, professional email to my manager. Write in a clear and professional tone suitable for workplace communication. Keep it polite, concise, and respectful."

If you save the second part of this prompt under `#email_to_manager`, your input becomes:

> "My son has a high fever and I need to stay home tomorrow to take care of him. #email_to_manager."

This makes the prompt much shorter and allows you to reuse `#email_to_manager` whenever you need to write an email to your manager. The extension also provides a website for sharing and managing prompts.

I'd love to hear your feedback and suggestions. Thanks!
