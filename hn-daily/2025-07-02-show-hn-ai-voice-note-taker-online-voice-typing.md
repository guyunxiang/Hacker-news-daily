# Show HN: AI Voice Note Taker – Online Voice Typing

**Posted by robgehring on 2025-07-02**

Hey everyone,

I recently built a lightweight Chrome extension called **AI Voice Note Taker** that lets you dictate notes directly in your browser—no extra apps or downloads needed.

### What makes it different?

1. **Real-Time Transcription**  
   Achieves up to 98% accuracy thanks to SpeechText.AI speech recognition technology.

2. **Built-In Auto-Punctuation with On/Off Toggle**  
   Automatically adds periods and question marks as you speak. You can turn this feature off with a single click if you prefer raw transcripts.

3. **Note History with Auto-Save**  
   Every session is automatically saved and stored in a searchable dropdown. Accidentally closed the tab? Your notes are still there.

4. **Support for 30+ Languages**  
   Switch input languages on the fly without reloading or reconfiguring anything—ideal for multilingual users or teams.

5. **Lightweight & Privacy-Friendly**  
   Everything runs locally in your browser. Your microphone input isn't sent to third-party servers unnecessarily. It only connects for transcription when needed.

6. **Custom Note Titles & Export Options**  
   Assign titles to your notes for easier organization. Download notes as text files or copy-paste into any editor or CMS.

Would love to hear your feedback!
