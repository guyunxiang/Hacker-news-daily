# Show HN: Track Budget – A simple, powerful personal finance tracker

**Posted by tomkolron on 2025-06-20**

I'm excited to introduce **Track Budget**, a personal finance app I built to make managing finances easier. Unlike many tools that feel bloated or unintuitive, this app aims to strike the right balance between simplicity and power.

## Core Features

- Upload and parse bank or credit card statements (CSV, XLSX, XLS)
- AI-powered transaction categorization
- Shared expense tracking
- Budgets by category

The app offers a 7-day free trial—no setup required. Just sign up and start exploring immediately.

## Feedback and Contact

It's still under active development, and I welcome feedback or suggestions for new features. Feel free to reach out via email at **tomkolron@gmail.com**.

Thanks for taking a look!
