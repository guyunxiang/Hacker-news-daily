# Hey, If You Know Anything About SAP – I Need Your Brain for a SEC

**Posted by Njord01 on 2025-07-02**

Hey HN!

We’re a small team building supply chain optimization tools for emerging markets. One of our core focuses is public procurement. We’re developing modules to analyze tenders, score suppliers based on risk, performance, and compliance, and even recommend matches based on tender specs.

Currently, we’re working on integrating this logic with SAP systems, particularly around SRM and sourcing modules. Think Ariba-level workflows, but more local and smarter.

If you’ve ever worked with SAP procurement, SRM, Ariba, or similar platforms — or have insights on supplier scoring, tender ranking, sourcing automation, or vendor risk analytics — we’d love to hear from you!

We’re still early in development but aim for a modular plugin-style integration. Gotchas, ideas, warnings, or war stories? I’d really appreciate any advice that could save us pain or help us explore new opportunities.

Thanks in advance!
