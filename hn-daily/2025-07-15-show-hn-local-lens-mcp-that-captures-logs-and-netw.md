# Show HN: Local Lens – MCP that captures logs and network reqs for debugging

**Posted by arthurtakeda on 2025-07-15**

Hi HN!

I built a tool I wish existed: it captures browser console messages, network requests, and backend server logs, then exposes them to an LLM via an MCP/http server.

It's completely local— all data is stored in a local SQLite file.

I welcome any feedback and hope you find it useful!
