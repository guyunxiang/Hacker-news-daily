# Show HN: GoAgentic – AI that does cold outreach better than I ever could

**Posted by nijfranck on 2025-08-06**

I’ve been developing an AI sales outreach agent that handles the entire cold outreach process—from finding leads to writing, sending, and following up on emails until a reply is received.

**The problem I wanted to solve:**  
I was spending hours crafting personalized cold emails, yet achieving only mediocre results. I realized the outreach process could be broken down into repeatable patterns—targeting, messaging, timing—and optimized through data.

**What GoAgentic does:**  
- Finds and qualifies leads based on your criteria  
- Generates highly personalized emails that don’t sound like AI spam  
- Sends and tracks emails with deliverability safeguards  
- Allows you to experiment with messaging and timing to find what works  
- Stops outreach when a reply is received, so you only step in when necessary

**I’d love feedback from HN on:**  
- How to make this more valuable for technical founders who dislike doing sales  
- The biggest red flags you see with AI-driven outreach tools  
- Whether you prefer a “set it and forget it” approach or more manual control over the AI’s actions
