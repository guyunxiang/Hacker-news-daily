# Ask HN: Worth leaving position over push to adopt vibe coding?  
**Posted by NotAnOtter on 2025-07-04**

My company is increasingly pushing prompt engineering as the only way we should be coding. The CEO and CTO are both obsessed with it and promote practices like deleting entire unit test files and having AI (e.g., Claude) generate new ones instead of manually fixing test failures.

I’m a senior engineer with around 5 years of industry experience, and I’m considering leaving this company because I don’t want:

- To be pushed into a workflow that will cause my technical growth to stall or degrade  
- To oversee a bunch of AI-generated spaghetti code 2-3 years from now

Feel free to address my specific situation, but I’m also interested in more general opinions.
