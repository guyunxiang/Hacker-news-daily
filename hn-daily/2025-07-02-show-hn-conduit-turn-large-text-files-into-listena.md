# Show HN: Conduit – Turn large text files into listenable audio

**Posted by tboneskibs on 2025-07-02**

Hey HN,

I built Conduit to solve a personal problem: I have a lot of long documents I want to read, but I retain information better by listening.

Most tools for turning text into audio are clunky, slow, or require lots of manual formatting—copy/paste, upload to another platform, tweak settings, etc. I wanted something that just works.

So I created Conduit—a simple tool that converts large text files (ebooks, blog posts, PDFs, etc.) into listenable audio within seconds, using realistic AI voices.

Currently, it’s just a waitlist and demo landing page, but I’d love early feedback:

- Does this scratch an itch for anyone else?
- What formats or features would make this more useful to you?
- Are there any blockers that would prevent you from using something like this?

You can check it out here: [Conduit Landing Page](https://conduit-landing-page-git-master-tobys-projects-a638df7e.vercel.app)

Thanks in advance—happy to answer questions or share how it’s built.
