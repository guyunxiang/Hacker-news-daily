# Ask HN: Can anybody clarify why OpenAI reasoning now shows non-English thoughts?

People have noticed for a while now that Google's Bard and Gemini models often insert random Hindi or Bengali words. 

For example, I recently caught this in an O3-Pro thought process: 

> "and customizing for low difficulty. কাজে করছে!"

The last part is Bengali for "working!"  

I'm curious why similar "errors" appear across multiple models. What training methods or reasoning could allow these alternate languages to creep in? Does anyone know?
