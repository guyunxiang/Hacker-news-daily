# The scam that is Visa Account Updater

**Posted by mountainriver on 2025-06-25**

Visa Account Updater is a service that automatically provides merchants with your new credit card details whenever you change or close your credit card, without ever asking for your permission.

I encountered an issue with difficult-to-cancel subscriptions, so I decided to cancel my credit card. I called Wells Fargo, requested a new card, and received one. Life moved on.

However, the following month, I noticed the same charges reappearing. When I called Wells Fargo, they explained about Visa Account Updater. I was shocked that such a service could operate without explicit consent. I told them I wanted to opt out, but they said Visa handles this, not them.

I contacted Visa directly; they redirected me back to Wells Fargo, claiming they don’t manage this either. When I asked Wells Fargo how to opt out, they were unsure. After searching their documentation, they confirmed there's no way to disable the service except closing the entire account and opening a new one.

Reluctantly, I did that. Yet, the next month, the same charges appeared on a brand new, unused card. I called Wells Fargo again, but they still couldn’t offer a way to turn off Visa Account Updater.

Now, I've been on hold for over two hours, trying to find a solution. I can't believe this is even legal. It feels like a scam designed to keep subscriptions charging to your card, regardless of your wishes.

I hope this information helps others facing the same frustration.
