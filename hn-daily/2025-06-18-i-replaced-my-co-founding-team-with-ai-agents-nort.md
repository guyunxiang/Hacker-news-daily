# I replaced my co-founding team with AI agents (Northstar Essential Automations)

**Posted by Admiral_Phoenix on 2025-06-18**

Hey HN! Admiral Phoenix here. I’ve built something unusual — a legitimate business where my ‘co-founders’ are specialized AI agents, each with defined roles.

- Orion (Chief Navigation Officer)
- Polaris (Chief Intelligence Officer)
- Nova (Automation Commander)

We’re automating businesses while documenting the journey in a comic-style format. The result? Real clients, real results, and zero founder burnout.
