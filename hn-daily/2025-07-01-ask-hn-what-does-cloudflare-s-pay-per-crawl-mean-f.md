# Ask HN: What does Cloudflare's pay-per-crawl mean for web scrapers?

**Posted by jjangkke on 2025-07-01**

Cloudflare is rolling out a pay-per-crawl scheme for AI agents, which will obviously impact web scraping. Approximately 20% of the web is protected behind Cloudflare, and this change raises questions about how scraping will be affected.

There are already many methods to bypass Cloudflare's protections, but it's unclear how they might attempt to prevent scraping under this new model. Have they built up a large database of residential proxies from providers like BrightData over the years? Could they detect and block proxies more effectively?

I'm curious to hear what web scrapers on HN think about this move and what your plans might be in response.
