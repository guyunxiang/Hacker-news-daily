# Show HN: I made a Canny alternative for indie founders and solo devs

**Posted by optinghost on 2025-07-09**

Hi HN,

I recently built and launched Upvoicy — a simple, focused alternative to Canny for collecting and managing user feedback.

The idea was born from frustration with tools that are either too complex or too expensive for small teams. With Upvoicy, users can:

- Submit new feedback quickly  
- Upvote ideas from others  
- Track what’s planned, in progress, or shipped  

No clutter, no distractions — just a clean workflow to help you stay close to your users and make better product decisions.

It’s best for indie makers, startups, or anyone who wants to listen to customers without the overhead.

Would love to hear what you think!
