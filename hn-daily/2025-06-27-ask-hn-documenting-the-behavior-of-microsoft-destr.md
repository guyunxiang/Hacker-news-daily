# Ask HN: Documenting the behavior of Microsoft destroying true sleep

**Posted by tryauuum on 2025-06-27**

Apparently, Microsoft is responsible for why modern laptops can't enter true sleep modes properly and why batteries drain quickly. According to some reports on the internet:

> I reached out to Dell support, and they told me that they don’t support S3 (deep sleep) simply because Windows 10 may cause a Blue Screen of Death after waking. They don’t support other operating systems, and they don’t give customers a choice.

Is there more documentation or evidence showing that Microsoft is forcing vendors to remove or disable S3 support? I want to be more certain about Microsoft's behavior before I dive into more negative opinions.
