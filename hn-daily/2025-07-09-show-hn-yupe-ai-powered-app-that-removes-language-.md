# Show HN: YUPE – AI-powered app that removes language barriers from restaurants

**Posted by drakochack on 2025-07-09**

Hi HN,  
I just launched YUPE, an iOS app that helps travelers understand and order from restaurant menus—even when they can’t read the local language.

## Why I built it

Food is one of the best ways to experience a culture, but language barriers often make it hard to know what you’re ordering.  
I wanted a way to explore any country’s gastronomy confidently—even if I couldn’t read the menu or speak the language.

## What it does

- Scan a menu  
- Chat with it — ask questions like “Is this spicy?” or “Which dishes are dairy-free?”  
- Get personalized suggestions based on your preferences and allergies  
- One-tap order — generates a polite, localized message you can show to the waiter

Currently supports 150+ languages. Designed for travelers, digital nomads, and curious foodies.

## Privacy

- No sign-up required for core features  
- Your food preferences are stored anonymously to personalize responses

Would love feedback from the HN community!
