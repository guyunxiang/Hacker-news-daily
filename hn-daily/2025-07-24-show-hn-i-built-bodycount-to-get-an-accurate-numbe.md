# Show HN: I built BodyCount to get an accurate 'number'  
**Posted by dsstudios on 2025-07-24**

For years, the question of my actual 'body count' was a nagging personal curiosity. My memory is fallible, and the common solutions—like keeping a list in a notes app or a spreadsheet—always felt insecure and strangely clinical. I wanted a tool built specifically for this purpose: a private, secure space to finally get an accurate number.

So, I built BodyCount.

Once I started inputting my own data—the information my brain had long forgotten—the project evolved. It became less about the final sum and more about the stories the data told. Visualizing connections on a map and observing patterns over time gave me a new perspective on my own history. It wasn’t just a number; it was a private, personal dataset that I owned and controlled.

From a technical standpoint, privacy was the top priority. The goal was to create a space that felt significantly more secure than a standard cloud notes app. All data is stored privately, ensuring user entries are for their eyes only.

I posted an earlier version here a few days ago and received valuable feedback. A common request was to allow users to try it out without hitting a paywall. So, I spent the last 48 hours implementing a freemium model. You can now log your first few connections and explore all features for free to see if it’s the right fit for you.

I’d love to hear your feedback on the new freemium flow and the overall concept. Is a private, data-driven dashboard a better solution than traditional notes for managing this kind of personal information?
