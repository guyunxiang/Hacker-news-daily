# Show HN: URL Unshortener Pro – Reveal redirect chains and trackers from URLs

**Posted by IndriFazliji on 2025-06-24**

I recently built URL Unshortener Pro, a free Chrome extension that:

- Expands shortened or obfuscated URLs (like bit.ly, t.co, etc.)
- Reveals the entire redirect chain, handling HTTP redirects, meta-refresh, and JavaScript-based redirects
- Flags known tracking domains
- Highlights and removes tracking parameters (utm_source, fbclid, etc.)
- Works quickly with smart caching
- Is 100% privacy-focused, with no tracking, ads, or external analytics

I created this tool out of personal frustration with opaque, tracking-heavy links commonly found on social media and news sites.

You can find it on the Chrome Web Store: [https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/url-unshortener-pro/mibajemffcbpbailkjgliajhplhcnnho](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/url-unshortener-pro/mibajemffcbpbailkjgliajhplhcnnho)

I’d love to hear your feedback, feature suggestions, or bug reports. Thanks!
