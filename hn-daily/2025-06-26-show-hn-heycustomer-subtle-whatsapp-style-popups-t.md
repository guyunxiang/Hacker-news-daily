# Show HN: Heycustomer – Subtle, WhatsApp-style popups that convert

**Posted by ardakaan on 2025-06-26**

Hey HN, I’m Arda, the creator of heycustomer.co — a micro-SaaS that replaces annoying popups with clean, human-friendly notifications inspired by WhatsApp.

We built this because traditional popups suck. They ruin user experience, harm conversions, and most visitors close them instantly. But subtle notifications, styled like the chats we check hundreds of times a day? That actually works.

With heycustomer, you can turn site messages into familiar, floating notifications — such as welcome notes, limited-time promotions, or custom links — all without disrupting your layout.

All plans are 20% off with code **heymate20** — and annual plans are incredibly affordable.

Would love to hear your feedback on the product, copy, or vibe!
