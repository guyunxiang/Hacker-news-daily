# Ask HN: Copilot Makes Me Dumb

**Posted by ynarwal__ on 2025-07-24**

I've been noticing that Copilot is essentially hijacking my problem-solving process. Instead of working through challenges myself, I find myself just accepting whatever it suggests, even when I haven't fully thought the problem through. It's making me mentally lazy.

The constant suggestions feel like having someone looking over your shoulder, blurting out answers before you've even finished forming the question. It really breaks your concentration and prevents you from developing your own solutions.

I'm considering disabling it for a while, maybe permanently. Don't get me wrongâ€”LLMs are incredibly useful for development work, but only when I deliberately choose to use them. Having them always on feels like it's weakening my ability to think independently.

I'm curious about what others on HN think about this. Has anyone else felt like these tools are changing how they approach problems?
