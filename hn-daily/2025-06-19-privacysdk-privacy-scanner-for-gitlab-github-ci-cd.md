# PrivacySDK – Privacy scanner for GitLab/GitHub CI/CD (12 languages, AI-powered)

**Posted by nabanitade on 2025-06-19**

Hi HN,

I just released PrivacySDK — a privacy and security vulnerability scanner that integrates directly with GitLab, GitHub, and various development CI/CD workflows. It scans your codebase for GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, and security violations using a combination of AI (Google Gemini via Vertex AI) and hardcoded rule engines.

Think of it as linting, but for privacy compliance.

## Key Features

- Compatible with GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions, and various development workflows  
- Supports 12+ programming languages (JavaScript, Python, Go, Java, etc.)  
- Combines AI detection with rule-based checks, ensuring reliability in production  
- Identifies privacy risks with severity levels  
- Provides specific privacy recommendations  
- Educates developers on privacy best practices during coding  
- Offers real-time feedback via merge request comments, auto-issue creation, and CI pipeline enforcement  
- Helps enforce privacy-by-design automatically  
- Includes a live website interface for instant privacy reviews of uploaded code  
- Fully documented, tested, and ready for DevSecOps teams  
- Open source for personal and non-commercial use
