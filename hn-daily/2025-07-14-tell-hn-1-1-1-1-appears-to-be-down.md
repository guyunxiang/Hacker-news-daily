# Tell HN: 1.1.1.1 Appears to Be Down

**Posted by Wingy on 2025-07-14**

Cloudflare's DNS server doesn't seem to be working right now. I tried pinging 1.1.1.1:

```plaintext
6:03PM storm ~ % ping 1.1.1.1
PING 1.1.1.1 (1.1.1.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
^C
--- 1.1.1.1 ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 3103ms
```

It looks like there's a connectivity issue with Cloudflare's DNS server at the moment.
