# Ask HN: Bad at Interviewing

**Posted by biskquickest on 2025-07-18**

I'm really not good at the live programming sections of interviews, regardless of how much I practice. I'm already a nervous person, but having someone watch me try to solve a problem makes me forget how to think, it seems.

I also struggle with the wide variance in interview formats. Sometimes it's about knowing how to use a specific library or being able to Google (without AI help) how to use it before time runs out. Other times, it's straightforward LeetCode questions. I feel I'm not strong in either area.

I've been working as a Software Engineer for 8 years and have consistently received above-average performance reviews. Iâ€™m confident I can do the job if given the opportunity, but proving my worth in interviews is really tough.

Is there anything I can do to improve this skill? I already dedicate a lot of time to practicing problems, but the time constraints and being monitored seem to have a significant impact on my performance. I thought it would get better with practice, but it hasn't, and honestly, it's exhausting always feeling the need to "be ready" for interviews.
