We have seen almost 750,000 layoffs since 2022.  

Where are all these people finding jobs? On Reddit’s r/layoffs, many are crying. Many have been searching for months, sometimes nearly a year.  

I spoke with someone during a customer discovery call who was begging for a job. I was really saddened by their situation, but I couldn't help—they've been looking for 18 months or more. Many job postings are fake or outdated.  

VCs and Silicon Valley giants seem eager to believe that a small team can build trillion-dollar software and maximize their investments.  

If AI automates even 20% of software engineering jobs, will we survive the resulting layoffs and economic downturns? What about software engineers, sales teams, and marketing professionals?  

It’s disturbing that companies raise funds in the US but outsource jobs to countries like India. Sometimes, this creates opportunities for scams like Soham’s. It could even be a manufactured PR stunt, similar to what Cluely’s Chunging Lee did.  

On one hand, companies create jobs; on the other, they outsource or cut back on human roles to save costs.  

Starting a company can seem pointless unless you get funded or become a hotshot like Cursor. For those who don’t know, Cursor gained fame in 2023 but was founded in 2022. They are MIT alumni, likely very smart, with many other options available to them.  

What are your thoughts, especially for those of us in middle age?  

And by the way, happy Fourth of July!
