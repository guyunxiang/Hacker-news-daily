# Ask HN: Should I use microservices or monolithic architecture?  
**Posted by its_kritix on 2025-07-03**

I'm building a SaaS application using an open-source project licensed under EPL 2.0, and I want to include my own AI functionality. For now, I plan to offer the product as a service (not distribute the software), but in the future, I might want to create a separate desktop AI app.

Given these plans, should I keep my AI code separate from the EPL 2.0 codebase from the start, or can I combine them for now and separate them later if needed? 

What are the pros and cons of each approach, especially regarding licensing, maintainability, and future flexibility?

I am a solo developer.
