# Show HN: I made a 3D printed VTOL drone

**Posted by tsungxu on 2025-06-10**

I built a VTOL drone capable of flying 130 miles and lasting 3 hours on a single charge. It’s likely one of the longest-range and longest-endurance 3D printed VTOLs in the world.

This is the project I’m most proud of to date! Before starting, I was a complete beginner in CAD, 3D printing, and aerodynamic modeling. I had only built and flown one VTOL before.

## Specs
- **Wingspan:** 3.9 ft (1200 mm)
- **Length:** 2.5 ft (770 mm)
- **Weight:** 5.6 lb (2.55 kg)

## Construction
- **Airframe:** Foam-printed PLA (Bambu PLA-Aero) and PETG structural parts printed on an A1 printer, with CFRP booms and spars
- **Battery:** Li-ion silicon anode Amprius SA08 cells, 6s2p pack by Upgrade Energy
- **Motors:** 2807 AOS for lift and cruise (unoptimized)
- **Lifting ESCs:** 4-in-1 Holybro Tekko32 F4 45A
- **Cruise ESC:** Flycolor Raptor 5 45A
- **Props:** 7042 Gemfan (unoptimized)
- **Flight controller:** Speedybee F405 Wing
- **GPS:** M10
- **Firmware:** Ardupilot 4.6.0

## Note
This video ended up shorter than I initially planned. As my first YouTube video with significant post-production, I underestimated the effort required to create a longer, in-depth video with voiceover, footage editing, and more.
