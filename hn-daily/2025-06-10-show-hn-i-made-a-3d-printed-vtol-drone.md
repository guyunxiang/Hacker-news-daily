# Show HN: I made a 3D printed VTOL drone

**Posted by tsungxu on 2025-06-10**

I built a 130-mile-capable VTOL drone in just 90 days. It can fly for 3 hours on a single charge, making it one of the longest-range and longest-endurance 3D-printed VTOLs in the world.

This is the project I am most proud of to date!

Before starting, I was a complete beginner in CAD, 3D printing, and aerodynamic modeling. I had only built and flown one VTOL before.

## Specs

- **Wingspan:** 3.9 ft (1200 mm)  
- **Length:** 2.5 ft (770 mm)  
- **Weight:** 5.6 lb (2.55 kg)  

## Airframe & Materials

- Foamboard made from PLA (Bambu PLA-Aero) and PETG structural parts printed on an A1 printer  
- CFRP booms and spars for reinforcement  

## Power System

- **Battery:** Li-ion silicon anode Amprius SA08 cells, 6s2p pack by Upgrade Energy  
- **Motors:** 2807 AOS motors for lift and cruise (unoptimized)  
- **Lifting ESCs:** Holybro Tekko32 F4 45A (4-in-1)  
- **Cruise ESC:** Flycolor Raptor 5 45A  
- **Props:** 7042 Gemfan (unoptimized)  

## Flight Control & Navigation

- **Flight controller:** Speedybee F405 Wing  
- **GPS:** M10  
- **Firmware:** Ardupilot 4.6.0

This video clip ended up shorter than I planned. Since it was my first YouTube video involving significant post-production work, I underestimated how much effort it takes to create a longer, in-depth video with voiceovers and edited footage.
