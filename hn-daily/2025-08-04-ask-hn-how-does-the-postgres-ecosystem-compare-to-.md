# Ask HN: How does the Postgres ecosystem compare to Vitess at 1PB+?

**Posted by GabrielBianconi on 2025-08-04**

I'm not an expert in databases.

The MySQL ecosystem has a mature open-source solution for scaling horizontally with Vitess.

The Postgres ecosystem seems to have alternatives like Citus, CockroachDB, etc.

Are they similarly mature? How do they compare for massive-scale deployments (1PB+ of data, insert-heavy workload)?
