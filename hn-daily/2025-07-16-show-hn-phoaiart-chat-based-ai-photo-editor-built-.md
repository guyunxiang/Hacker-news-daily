# Show HN: Phoaiart – Chat-Based AI Photo Editor Built with Flux Kontext

**Posted by incendies on 2025-07-16**

Hey HN!  

I’ve just launched PHOAIART, an AI-powered photo editor that allows users to edit images simply by chatting—no buttons, no sliders, just natural language. You can say things like “change my hair to red” or “remove the background,” and the AI handles it instantly.  

I built it using Flux Kontext for natural language image transformation, along with Firebase (Firestore + Auth) and React Native for the core app logic. The goal was to make image editing as easy as texting a friend.  

Would love your feedback, suggestions, or ideas for improvement!
