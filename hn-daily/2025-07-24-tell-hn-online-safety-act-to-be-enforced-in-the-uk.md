# Tell HN: Online Safety Act to be enforced in the UK on July 25th

**Posted by trycatchthroawy on 2025-07-24**

The UK’s Online Safety Act aims to enforce new measures starting tomorrow, July 25th. 

According to the official statement from Ofcom:

> "Tech firms must introduce age checks to prevent children from accessing porn, self-harm, suicide, and eating disorder content."

Several major platforms such as Bluesky, Discord, Grindr, Reddit, and X have committed to implementing age-gating. Ofcom is now setting enforcement targets.

It appears that relying solely on "parental controls" is no longer sufficient in the UK. The proposed solutions are more invasive — akin to the government pushing Apple to allow access to user data in iCloud, even when that data isn't protected by end-to-end encryption.

What do you think about these measures?
