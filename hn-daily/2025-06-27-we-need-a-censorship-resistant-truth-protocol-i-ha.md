# We need a censorship-resistant truth protocol – I have the idea, not the skills

I’ve been thinking about the growing trend of censorship and narrative control around the world. I’m neither a developer nor involved in crypto, and I lack the technical skills to build this myself. But I can’t ignore what I see happening anymore.

It’s no longer a conspiracy theory to say that governments — whether authoritarian or “democratic” — openly work to restrict certain kinds of information. They regulate platforms, enforce takedowns, threaten with fines, and weaponize “disinformation” laws. What they truly fear isn’t chaos or lies; it’s unfiltered truth.

Truth that hasn’t been interpreted, branded, fact-checked by “partners,” or buried algorithmically. Raw, uncomfortable, unpredictable, and most importantly — uncontainable.

### What We Need

I believe we need a protocol — not a company, platform, or brand — that makes censorship of truth technically and socially unviable. Not because it’s illegal to censor, but because it becomes inherently impossible to do without significant backlash or failure.

Historical examples show what happens when power feels threatened: platforms are co-opted, founders face pressure, policies shift. Even Twitter, promising “free speech,” is already bending. Facebook aligns with state interests. YouTube can remove videos for medical misinformation. Substack and Rumble hold promise but remain choke points — targetable, fragile, and not fully decentralized.

### A Living, Breathing Immune System for Truth

What we need is something like an immune system for truth — a protocol that distributes critical information via a torrent-like network: redundantly, irreversibly, autonomously. 

This system should allow people to report corruption, abuse of power, hypocrisy, waste, and more — with evidence uploaded, validated, analyzed, and published in a way that no single entity can erase.

### Features of an Uncensorable Truth Protocol

- Mechanisms for anonymous whistleblowing  
- AI-based pattern detection to connect dots across cases  
- Public scoring for politicians, judges, institutions, agencies  
- Tracking promises made versus promises kept  
- Reputation systems based on actions, not marketing  
- Transparency of public funds  
- Default radical transparency  

All backed by decentralized storage and consensus mechanisms.

### Why This Matters

While parts of this may already exist, it’s not unified, not bulletproof, not trusted, and most importantly — not designed from the start to make truth unstoppable.

This idea — which I call **VERITAS** — isn’t about ideology or party politics. It’s about facts, evidence, and accountability. And it should be fundamentally immune to ownership, monetization, co-option, or shutdown.

### The Urgency

This may sound ambitious, but I believe it’s necessary. Today’s state survives largely through narrative control, not legitimacy. If we remove that — through transparent, data-driven truth — we can transform how power operates.

### An Invitation

I’m not asking for donations or launching a project today. I just want to find others who feel the same urgency. People who understand the technical side and might want to sketch out what such a system could look like.

Feel free to fork, steal, build, improve, or reach out. I want this to exist — because time is running out, and the walls are closing in.

Once truth becomes fully permissioned, we risk losing everything.

Let’s make it uncensorable — before it’s too late.
