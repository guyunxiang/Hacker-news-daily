# Show HN: BossOrToss – Vote on Real Executives (Anonymously)

**Posted by santiix on 2025-07-31**

We built [BossOrToss.wtf](https://BossOrToss.wtf) as a way to anonymously vote on real executives—the CIOs, CTOs, CEOs, and VPs who influence your Zoom nightmares or career wins.

It’s part satire, part corporate commentary:
- Vote anonymously on executives pulled from public LinkedIn data.
- Submit new profiles if your “favorite” leader is missing.

Help crown the weekly Top Boss and Biggest Toss. View cartoonified avatars, sarcastic bios, and a rotating leaderboard.

We don’t collect any personal data. All profiles use publicly available LinkedIn info and user submissions (which are reviewed). It’s a social experiment designed to gamify perceptions of leadership, with a touch of snark.

We’d love feedback from the HN community—does this resonate? Should we evolve it into a real feedback tool? Or just enjoy the chaos?

Hate your boss? Love your boss? Go ahead and let everyone know, anonymously.
