# Show HN: I Turned PG's "How to Get Startup Ideas" into an Interactive Course

**Posted by hedayet on 2025-07-04**

Most startup education is passive—you read essays or watch videos and hope the lessons stick. 

But real learning happens through practice and decision-making, not just content consumption.

So I took Paul Graham’s classic essay, *"How to Get Startup Ideas,"* and turned it into a 5-minute interactive course. Instead of merely reading about how to spot good ideas, you make decisions like a founder—choosing between ideas, reflecting on user needs, and building pattern recognition.

Early feedback has been encouraging:

> "I loved this!!! This was so fun to take." — ex-Google founder

> "Simple but so effective! They really made me think." — corporate research analyst

It takes about 5 minutes to try. I’d appreciate any feedback on the format, user experience, or the value it provides!
