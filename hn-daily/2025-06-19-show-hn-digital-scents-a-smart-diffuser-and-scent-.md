# Show HN: Digital Scents – A smart diffuser and scent streaming service

**Posted by openbookmarksco on 2025-06-19**

Hi HN,

We’re building *Digital Scents*, the world’s first scent streaming platform with a smart diffuser and a universal scent format (USF). Just as music and video transitioned into digital and streamable formats, we believe scent is the next sensory frontier.

Our system allows users to stream, personalize, and even create scents using a mobile app and our proprietary diffuser. It’s all powered by a standardized digital scent format that enables scent distribution, sharing, and monetization on a global scale.

### What sets Digital Scents apart:
- A smart diffuser that reproduces over 10,000 scent profiles via the app
- Creator mode, allowing creators to sell their scent compositions
- Partnerships with luxury hotels, salons, game studios, and wellness brands
- Patent-pending Web3/NFT technology to authenticate scent intellectual property
- Selected by JETRO for the J-StarX Silicon Valley program

We’re exploring applications across wellness, hospitality, gaming, and entertainment. We’re also open to feedback, collaborations, and investment discussions.

We’d love to hear your thoughts on how scent can become a part of the digital experience.
