# Testing the full AI editorial system on No Cap Blog

**Posted by McSeneka on 2025-07-31**

I recently tested No Cap's AI capabilities. The AI centered the conversation around a project I’ve been developing for several months, aimed at converting it into a SaaS product. I suggested that it would be beneficial to include some public use cases, which led me to create the No Cap blog using my system.

Since this is the first public project and is closely related to YC, I’d love to hear your feedback. The content generated by the autonomous system is available at [https://nocap.blog/founder/](https://nocap.blog/founder/). There are over 8,000 founder profiles from all YC batches.

I built AutoPost for commercial and transactional purposes, but it also seems effective for informational use. In just a few days (4 days since launch), it has attracted over 300 organic visitors.

Thank you very much for your support and any feedback you may have.
