# Show HN: Cursor for Fitness

**Posted by asdev on 2025-06-30**

Hi all!

I’ve been using ChatGPT to create and tweak my workout programs for a while now — but it was always a hassle. I had to manually type the workouts into my tracking app, and if I wanted AI to give feedback or adjust things based on what I actually did, I had to copy everything back into ChatGPT.

So I built something to fix that.

It’s an app that integrates AI directly into the workout tracking flow — no more copy-pasting between ChatGPT and a separate app.

## Features:
- Chat with AI to generate full training programs or individual workouts
- Workouts load instantly into the app for easy tracking
- Log sets and reps with a clean interface, or simply chat:  
  *"I did 5 sets of squats at 135 lbs"* — saved automatically
- Ask the AI for advice, tweaks, and recommendations based on your workout history

It’s still in early beta, and I’d really appreciate any feedback!
