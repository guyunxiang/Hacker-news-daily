# Ask HN: Are you designing APIs to be "AI-ready"?

**Posted by CER10TY on 2025-07-23**

What I mean by "AI-ready" (I realize this is a bit of a buzzword) is whether you're spending time to ensure your APIs are well-designed, consistent with error codes and messages, etc., to make them more accessible for Large Language Models (LLMs). I'm not talking about MCPs.

If so, how are you making sure that this design stays consistent and that every team member agrees on it?
