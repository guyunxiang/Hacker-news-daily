# Show HN: GitHub-style Markdown note app to test README content

**Posted by kukuhsain on 2025-07-16**

Hello hackers,

I built Readmenote, an online web app for creating notes in a GitHub-style format. It's great for previewing how your README content will appear.

No login required. Free. Your data is saved in your browser.

The app is built using react-markdown, Next.js, and other technologies.

Take a look at [https://www.readmenote.com/](https://www.readmenote.com/). If you have any feedback, please let me know. Thank you!
