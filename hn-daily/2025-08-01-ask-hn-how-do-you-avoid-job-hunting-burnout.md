# Ask HN: How do you avoid job hunting burnout?  
**Posted by b8 on 2025-08-01**

I've been applying to hundreds of jobs over the past few months without receiving any offers. I went through 7 interviews with a single company only to be rejected in the end. Some virtual loop interviews ended with no response or ghosting, and most applications donâ€™t even result in a rejection email. This experience is really draining and has worsened my depression and anxiety. How do you all cope with job hunting burnout?
