# Show HN: Reeroll – Lovable for Video

**Posted by alonzuman7 on 2025-06-18**

Reeroll is a tool that allows you to create short videos for your business using AI, without the need for complex timeline editors—just a simple chat interface.

Creating a video is straightforward: choose a template from the homepage and prompt it with something like, “Make this video about mybusiness.com.” Reeroll will fetch content from your website and customize the video accordingly. You can also manually upload images, logos, and videos to give it more context or create a video entirely from scratch.

I built Reeroll after seeing my parents struggle to produce consistent content for their business's Instagram page. Instead of helping manually, I automated the process as a software engineer.

Would love your feedback!
