# Show HN: Empromptu.ai – No code, AI app builder with RAG, model, evals etc.

**Posted by anaempromptu on 2025-07-30**

Hey HN! We're Empromptu.ai, an AI app builder that creates AI applications with built-in RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), models, and evaluation tools—all integrated into each app.

We started Empromptu after burning through thousands of credits on various AI builders and encountering the same problem: prototypes or demos that look great but break once real users start interacting.

The core issue wasn’t in building; it was in achieving reliable accuracy. Most AI applications plateau around 60% accuracy, which might be acceptable for prototypes but is unusable in production. We realized these existing tools aren’t true "AI app builders"—they’re essentially website builders that happen to incorporate AI.

Our goal was to solve the hardest problem first: making AI applications actually work reliably.

## Our Approach: Dynamic Optimization

Instead of stuffing every possible scenario into one massive prompt—which confuses large language models (LLMs)—our system adapts contextually. For example, a travel chatbot automatically knows to mention LAX for Los Angeles and Pearson for Toronto. This approach consistently delivers around 90% accuracy, significantly higher than the industry standard of 60%.

## Addressing the Builder Gap

Accuracy alone isn’t enough. We also needed to bridge the builder gap:

- **Simple builders (like Lovable, Bolt):** Create static websites, not AI apps.
- **Complex ML tools:** Require dedicated teams, which most startups don’t have (examples: Arize, Voxel51). We've heard from both technical and non-technical founders that such tools can be overwhelming.
- **Missing piece:** Tools that allow building applications with embedded AI functionalities.

## Our Solution: AI Agents with Built-in Optimization

We built AI agents that include optimization capabilities. Users simply describe what they want to build, and our agents handle the full development pipeline—creating applications with embedded models, RAG, and intelligent processing. You can deploy your apps on your own infrastructure via Netlify, GitHub, or even run them locally.

## Who It's For

Startups, solo hackers, and enterprises can now develop AI apps or add AI features without needing to hire a dedicated ML team.
