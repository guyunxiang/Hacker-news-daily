# Show HN: AI Illustrated Stories for Stuffed Animals

**Posted by donkey_wobble on 2025-06-19**

This is my attempt to do something fun with generative AI. I've tested it with some family members, and their kids seem to love it. It’s a bit pricey to make the stories, and I’ve gone back and forth on pricing models. For now, I’ve decided to keep it free. If it gains traction, I can explore monetization options later.

I’d love to get your feedback on the site!

**Technical Details:**  
This project was built with Next.js, hosted on Vercel, and developed using Cursor + Claude Code. Since my workplace doesn’t allow the use of Cursor or Claude Code, this has been an eye-opening experience to see how capable these tools really are. I work professionally with React, but mainly for internal tooling, so I don’t usually do server-side rendering. It was nice to get hands-on with these AI tools.
