# Show HN: Ikuyo a Travel Planning Web Application

**Posted by kenrick95 on 2025-06-11**

Hi HN,

Over the past approximately 8 months, I’ve been developing a side project to assist with my travel planning. While progress was slow in the initial months, the last three months have seen significant feature additions in preparation for my upcoming trip later this year.

I've detailed the feature set in my blog [here](https://blog.kenrick95.org/2025/06/ikuyo-plan-your-next-trip/), but in summary, it includes:

- A timetable view of activities, accommodations, and daily plans
- Both list and map views of these elements
- Commenting functionality
- An expense tracker
- Sharing and collaboration with friends

The source code is available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/kenrick95/ikuyo). 

Here's an example of a view-only trip: [see it here](https://ikuyo.kenrick95.org/trip/2617cd98-a229-45d4-9617-5265d52317cd/home).

So far, I’m quite satisfied with the features and feel the project is making good progress in helping me organize my trips.

Let me know what you think! Thanks.
