# Show HN: 1-click analytics for startups (https://arka.so)

**Posted by LunarFrost88 on 2025-07-15**

Hey HN,

I'm Ari, formerly leading AI at Asana and building databases at AWS. We created Arka to help startups gain insights from their data without needing to build a full analytics stack.

Does this sound familiar?

- Your investors, customers, product, marketing, and ops teams are all asking for answers  
- Your data is spread across Postgres, Stripe, Segment, maybe Databricks, or even Slack  
- Your dashboards are outdated, writing the right query takes forever, and reporting is a mess  

**Arka is your all-in-one data analytics solution:**  

- Connects to your databases and SaaS tools instantly  
- Auto-generates clean metrics from messy data  
- Allows anyone to ask questions in plain English — no SQL or Python required  
- Builds reports, schedules alerts, and automates insights  

Think of it as a combination of Metabase + dbt + automated reporting, without the need to staff a full data team.

It’s still early, but Arka is already helping early adopters get up and running faster than anything they’ve used before.  

We’re now onboarding a few more early adopters. If you're a startup, we’ll personally help you set up — connecting your tools, defining clean metrics, and building reports.

**No cost during early access.** Just bring your data, and we’ll handle the rest.
