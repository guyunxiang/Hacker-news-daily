# Show HN: Vim-like text editor in Go (LSP, TreeSitter, Themes)

**Posted by andrew_bbb on 2025-06-12**

Hey! Check out my "toy" text editor which I use as my daily driver.

## Features

- LSP autocomplete, goto definition, hover info
- Tree-sitter support
- Color themes (borrowed from the Helix text editor)
- Lots of bugs (it's a work in progress)
- Macro support
- Emacs org-mode-like functionality: Open `test.txt`, place the cursor at line 15, and press **"Ctrl-C Ctrl-C"**

This project was written as a *speed run* — not for speed in terms of time, but as an exercise to explore the text editor problem space without overthinking or planning ahead. It’s a quick and "dirty" implementation, so expect rough edges.
