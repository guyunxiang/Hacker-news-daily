# MatrixTransformer: Structural Pattern Discovery Without Training

**Posted by AyodeleFikayomi on 2025-07-23**

MatrixTransformer is a tool that scans raw matrices to identify symbolic structures such as rank, symmetry, and entropyâ€”no labels or training needed. It works across various domains including biology, text, and graphs.

You can try it in these notebooks:
- [MyBinder Demo](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fikayoAy/MatrixTransformer/HEAD?filepath=run_demo.ipynb)
- [Google Colab Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/fikayoAy/MatrixTransformer/blob/main/run_demo.ipynb)

For the source code, visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fikayoAy/MatrixTransformer).

This approach is great for data understanding, anomaly detection, or algorithm selection.
