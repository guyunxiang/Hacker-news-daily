# What I Have Learned About Startups From Building My Own

**Posted by Taikhoom10 on 2025-07-30**

Build and launch quickly. Focus on charging your customers and assessing the situation.

Talk to customers to deeply understand the problem you're solving.

Don’t buy into conventional wisdom blindly. Use first principles thinking to guide your decisions.

Venture capital isn’t always the right path. Again, avoid taking conventional wisdom at face value.

Regularly talk to your users and iterate based on their feedback.

You don’t need to hire a large team; often, a small, focused team is more effective and productive.

Follow the advice of thinkers like Paul Graham, Steve Blank, and others.

Always learn from your failures. Iterate and pivot when necessary.

Identify market gaps and fill them—find opportunities to solve unmet needs.

Be delusional in your vision but stay grounded in reality.

Constantly test new ideas and approaches.

Learn how your users interact with your product to improve it continually.

Avoid obsessing over adding features. Start by doing one thing exceptionally well, then add features on top of that.

When it comes to marketing, avoid paid ads—they often result in poor conversions. If your product is truly great, your users will do the marketing for you.
