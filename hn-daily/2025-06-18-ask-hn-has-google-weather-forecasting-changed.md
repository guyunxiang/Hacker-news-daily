# Ask HN: Has Google Weather Forecasting Changed?

**Posted by windyshrimp on 2025-06-18**

I've often searched for "[city] weather" on Google, but I've been getting results that differ significantly from other sources like Weather.com.

For example, checking Palo Alto today shows a 10°F difference: Google reports 74°F, while Weather.com shows 84°F.

I first noticed this last week, and since then, Google Weather has consistently forecasted temperatures at least 5°F cooler than other services.

Similarly, when looking at the forecast for Chicago for the upcoming week, Google Weather's high temperatures are always more than 5°F lower than those from Weather.com, AccuWeather, and Wunderground.

Does anyone know what methodology Google Weather is using, or why there might be this discrepancy?
