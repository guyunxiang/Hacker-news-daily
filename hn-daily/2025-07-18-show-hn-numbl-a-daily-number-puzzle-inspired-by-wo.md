# Show HN: Numbl – A daily number puzzle inspired by Wordle and Sudoku

**Posted by henryjburg on 2025-07-18**

I had an idea for a game that fuses my favorite time-waster games, Wordle and Sudoku, so I made my own daily number puzzle: **Numbl**.

Basically, you need to fill the rows and columns with a unique set of digits 1-9, where each row or column has a specific constraint (such as sum, all odd, all even, range, etc.). The puzzle generates a new challenge each day, but you can also try a random puzzle by pressing "New Game."

At work, I’m gradually integrating AI into my workflow. I used this project as a testbed for rapid prototyping and validation—trying out AI-driven development without outsourcing the core design or compromising my engineering approach.

I ended up with a finished product I actually want to maintain, so I thought I’d share it here and invite any constructive advice or criticism from the community!
