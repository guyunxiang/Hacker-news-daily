This is a small tool called unrav.io. It's a bookmarklet that allows you to transform any webpage directly using AIâ€”no extensions, no copying and pasting. Just click and choose what you'd like to do:

- Summarize the page  
- Turn it into a podcast  
- Visualize it as a mindmap  
- Chat with the content

It's early days, but already surprisingly useful. Curious to hear what people think!
