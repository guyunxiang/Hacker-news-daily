**Posted by kohii on 2025-07-11**

Hey HN!  
I've been building CSV editors for 15 years. This is my third rewrite, and I finally think I’ve got it right.

## Key Features

- Excel-like operation for intuitive use  
- Equipped with basic to advanced tools for handling CSV files  
- Supports various formats and character encodings, and can handle CSVs with different column counts  
- Cross-platform (Windows, Mac; Linux coming soon)  
- Opens 100MB files in just 1.6 seconds — 12x faster than Excel  

## Tech Stack

Built with Tauri (Rust + React/TypeScript/TailwindCSS)  

## Feedback & Details

I would love feedback from anyone dealing with large datasets daily!
