# Show HN: MCP Adapter – Universal gateway for AI tool coordination

**Posted by tartakovsky on 2025-07-16**

Hi HN! I just shipped MCP Adapter after two weeks of building.

## What it does
MCP Adapter acts as a gateway for AI coding assistants (such as Cursor, Claude, and Copilot) to connect to external tools and services. It’s ideal for development setups—I use it daily with Claude Code to streamline my workflow.

## Why I built it
AI coding assistants often need to connect to various services, but managing these connections can be messy. There’s no clean, consolidated way to handle them. Additionally, unrestricted access for agents raises security and performance concerns. MCP Adapter addresses these issues by providing a controlled, centralized interface.

## Current state
- Production-ready with over 200 tests  
- Works well for personal development workflows  
- Supports basic authentication and tool routing  
- Exploring additional features based on community feedback

## The bigger picture
This could evolve into a broader infrastructure for organizations deploying AI agents. Centralized control over tool access is crucial for security and scalability. For now, though, it’s primarily solving my immediate need of coordinating AI tools during development.

## Code & Demo
Check out the repository: [https://github.com/startakovsky/mcp-adapter](https://github.com/startakovsky/mcp-adapter)  
(See the README for a quick 1-minute demo.)

I’d love to hear feedback on the approach and hear if others are facing similar challenges in coordinating AI tools.
