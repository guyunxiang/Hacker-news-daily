# Ask HN: Cofounder Equity Battle

**Posted by sjohns21 on 2025-07-28**

I vested 16% in a startup valued at approximately $1 million.  
The cofounder and I had ongoing conflicts for months, leading us to decide I should transition out.  

I initiated the exit, and although he resisted at first, he eventually agreed. However, after my cooperative transition, he issued a termination notice “for cause,” citing unmet company expectations and pointing to his complaints during our disputes. He also invoked his board rights to reclaim all of my vested equity, though he claimed he would only take back 97%.  

This has been the worst betrayal of my career. While he can do this contractually, I believe it can be challenged. Furthermore, he is holding six months of my salary as leverage to force me to sign away my equity. I was willing to return some equity, but his approach was everything wrong—immediate legal threats, leveraging the board, and salary coercion, without any prior discussion.  

I politely declined his initial offer. I’ve consulted a reputable firm (Grellas Shah), and I believe I have a strong case.  
Is it worth fighting? That’s debatable. The grounds he’s citing are baseless. During our last company meeting, he even called me “the best in San Francisco.”  

I’m already involved in a better venture, but I’m still considering whether to let this slide.  

He faces potential civil and criminal penalties depending on how this plays out.  

Thoughts on a strategy?
