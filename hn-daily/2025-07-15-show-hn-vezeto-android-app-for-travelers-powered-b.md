# Show HN: Vezeto â€“ Android app for travelers powered by AI

**Posted by dujma on 2025-07-15**

During my travels, I often came across interesting places but struggled to find information about them. This was especially true for lesser-known attractions in smaller towns. Additionally, online information was often in foreign languages, requiring translation, or I simply didn't have the time to search for articles on my phone to learn more.

To improve the travel experience, I developed **Vezeto**, an app that searches for tourist spots within a 5-kilometer radius. It provides basic information about attractions and features an AI-powered assistant that answers questions. The app also allows users to select a location on the map to discover nearby tourist attractions.

Vezeto supports 11 languages.
