# Show HN: I Made an App That Turns Your Life Memories into Manga

**Posted by djnd on 2025-07-03**

I enjoy reading manga and journaling. Recently, I started wondering what would happen if I combined the two. I wanted a different way to document moments in my life—something that's almost as personal as writing but also easy to share with friends.

That’s how the idea of turning life memories into manga came about. With MangaMe, you can take any moment from your life—whether it's a funny story or the most mundane daily activity—and turn it into a manga page to keep or share.

The hardest part has been getting the AI to keep characters looking consistent across different panels, especially since I only require one selfie for character modeling. Sometimes, the text in speech bubbles still gets jumbled, but I think it’s at a point where I can share it and gather feedback.

It's a bit of a hard paywall since I’m using GPT-4 for image generation, but I currently have a promotion offering 3 free credits. I’d love for you to check it out and let me know what you think or if you run into any weirdness.

Thanks!
