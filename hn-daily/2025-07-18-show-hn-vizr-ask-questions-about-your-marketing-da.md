# Show HN: Vizr – Ask questions about your marketing data, get real answers

**Posted by arifliftos on 2025-07-18**

Hi HN,

I built Vizr because I was tired of jumping between dashboards and still not knowing what the hell was going on in my campaigns.

Vizr connects to your GA4, ad platforms, or Segment, and allows you to ask plain English questions like:

- “Why did our CPA spike yesterday?”
- “Which channel brought the most trial users this week?”
- “How’s our retargeting performing in EMEA?”

You get:

- A chart
- A two-sentence explanation
- A one-click action you can take (like pausing a campaign or reallocating budget)

No dashboards to build, no SQL, no BI bottlenecks.

We’re currently in early access, and I’d love to receive feedback from individuals building GTM motions, growth teams, or analytics tooling. I’m especially curious about what you would ask if your data actually responded like a smart teammate.

You can join the waitlist here: [https://vizr.app](https://vizr.app)

Thanks!
