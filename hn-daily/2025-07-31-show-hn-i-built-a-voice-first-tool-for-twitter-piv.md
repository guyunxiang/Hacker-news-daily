# Show HN: I built a voice-first tool for Twitter, pivoted to cursor for X

**Posted by siim on 2025-07-31**

Earlier this July, I had a rare week of focused time and built a tool that lets you call in, speak your idea, and schedule a Twitter post. My background is in voice tech, which helped me understand how these systems work. Within three weeks, I launched a voice-first version, using ElevenLabs to bring it to life.

After launching, it didn’t gain much traction. One user on X tried it out and suggested adding a UI for editing posts before publishing. I realized that relying solely on voice wasn’t enough.

Last week, I brainstormed a chat-based, cursor-like interface, which I quickly implemented. Now, X11.social allows you to start with a voice dump or typed text, then edit and refine your posts before sending them to X.

I’m still exploring the market here. With no marketing experience, I’ve been sharing video logs and documenting my journey on X. During this process, I’ve met many interesting people in a very short time.

If you’re interested in creating authentic posts for X without overthinking, I’d love to hear any feedback.

By the way, X11 isn’t related to the old X11 protocol. The “X” stands for the platform, and “11” is a nod to voice AI, inspired by ElevenLabs. I’m almost done building custom voice infrastructure, but I kept the name because it fits the “call to tweet” vision.
