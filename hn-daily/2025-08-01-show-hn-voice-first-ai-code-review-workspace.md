# Show HN: Voice-First AI Code Review Workspace

**Posted by musbemus on 2025-08-01**

Hey HN,

We’re Mus and Isaac, creators of LightLayer.

We’ve been generating significantly more code since adopting agentic development tools, which has been fantastic. However, a new bottleneck has emerged: code reviews are becoming increasingly time-consuming and complex, even as code output accelerates.

We’d love to hear from folks here—are you also feeling the inertia of code reviews with the rise in development velocity? For us, this challenge motivated us to pivot our focus and build a workspace specifically designed to revolutionize the code review process in the AI era.

**What makes our workspace different?**

We’re not just an auto-commenting PR bot (like CodeRabbit, Greptile, Graphite, etc.). Those tools are useful for initial issue detection, but human review is here to stay. Our goal is to empower reviewers with a consolidated, context-rich workspace that helps them review more quickly without sacrificing understanding or quality.

We've combined all the essential parts of GitHub—discussions, file tree navigation, diffs, timeline events—into a single view that both humans and our AI assistant, Lux, can see and interact with in real-time. Think of it as a live review session with a senior team member. We drew inspiration from how much faster our reviews became when we could involve others in live sessions.

The UI centers around voice interaction to replicate the natural flow of conversation—making the review process more intuitive and engaging.

**Try it out:**

Just sign in and paste any public GitHub PR URL. Highlight code snippets or click on comments for Lux to focus on. You can speak naturally, and Lux will:

- Point out relevant parts of the code
- Explain issues
- Draft comment suggestions

**Note:**

This is still a work in progress. Lux doesn’t yet have full context of the entire codebase, and we’re actively working on bugs related to conversation flow (please report any bugs via our bug nub). We also plan to add features such as integrations with Slack, Linear, and support for personalized comment tones.

Our goal is to showcase the experience we’re targeting and provide value for those seeking a more delightful, efficient code review process.

**We’d greatly appreciate your feedback!**
