Telnyx has announced the addition of versioning and canary deployment support for AI Agents. Now, you can create multiple versions of your agent, compare their performance in real time, and roll out updates gradually using canary deployments. This allows for safer testing of changes before they go fully live, providing greater confidence and speed in deploying production-ready AI Agents.
