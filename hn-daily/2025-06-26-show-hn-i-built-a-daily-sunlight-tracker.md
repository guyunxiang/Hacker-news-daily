# Show HN: I built a daily sunlight tracker

**Posted by vickipow on 2025-06-26**

I kept trying to explain how important outdoor light is and how most people aren’t getting enough. Eventually, I realized that showing is more effective than telling.

So, we built a free app that uses your Apple Watch or iPhone to automatically track your light exposure throughout the day.

The app tells you if you're getting enough sunlight, shows your consistency over time, and rewards habits that support hormone balance.

It’s currently in beta on TestFlight—let me know what you think!
