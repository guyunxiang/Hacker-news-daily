# Ask HN: What is a physically disabled person to do in this job market?

**Posted by amathew on 2025-07-14**

I am 39 years old with cerebral palsy and use a walker due to mobility issues. I lost my job in late January 2025. Previously, I worked as a senior data scientist and have been applying for roles in analytics, business intelligence, and data science.

Six months have passed, and I am still unemployed.

How have others with disabilities overcome the challenges in this market? I’m feeling completely lost and unsure of how to proceed. I’ve rewritten my resume and do get interview opportunities, but there have been four instances where I completed the interview process, only to see another candidate hired instead.
