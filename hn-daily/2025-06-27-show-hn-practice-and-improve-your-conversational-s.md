# Show HN: Practice and Improve Your Conversational Skills with AI

**Posted by Kehvinbehvin on 2025-06-27**

Hi HN,

I'm Kevin. I built this tool to enhance my own conversational skills. Originally, I was practicing various scenarios inspired by *The Fine Art of Small Talk* by Debra Fine, using ElevenLabs AI agents. I found it helpful to copy transcripts into ChatGPT for feedback, and this project aims to streamline that workflow.

The platform allows you to practice conversations with AI agents and receive feedback on your interactions. You can choose from a few preset avatars and scenarios, which I'll update based on what users find most useful.

Since it's still early, I would appreciate any thoughts, suggestions, or critiques.
