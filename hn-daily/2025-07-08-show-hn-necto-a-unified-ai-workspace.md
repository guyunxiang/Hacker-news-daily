# Show HN: Necto – A Unified AI Workspace

**Posted by fraco on 2025-07-08**

Hey HN!

We are Francesco and Lorenzo. After getting tired of having 42 tabs open, copying and pasting prompts around, and losing responses in random notes, we wanted a single place to do our job.

We built Necto Spaces with the goal of simplifying our workflow. Our aim is to expand the product into the ultimate space for vibe working.

## What Necto Is

Necto is a customizable workspace composed of color-coded blocks, each serving a different purpose—chat, notes, bookmarks, and more. All blocks work together to create a shared context that any AI model can instantly access and utilize.

We’d love to hear your feedback and ideas!

Thanks!
