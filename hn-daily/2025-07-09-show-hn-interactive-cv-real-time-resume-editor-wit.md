# Show HN: Interactive CV – Real-time resume editor with ATS-optimized templates

**Posted by AIHiredMe on 2025-07-09**

Hi HN,

Seven months ago, I shared the Interactive CV as a React learning project during paternity leave. Thanks to your feedback, it has evolved significantly.

The biggest change is the rebuilt editor for real-time editing. I had to switch from standard PDF libraries to react-pdf-renderer, which initially caused quite a few headaches, but it’s now working smoothly with live previews — and it was worth the effort.

### Major updates since version 1:
- **Real-time CV editor** – no more clunky forms
- **Six new ATS-friendly templates**
- **Improved AI job matching algorithm**
- **Completely redesigned user experience**

The app now has usage limits, though you can try everything for free. There’s also a full demo available on the landing page so you can test it without signing up.

My goal remains the same: I got tired of spending hours tweaking my resume for different job applications. The workflow is now much smoother.

What features or improvements would make this tool truly useful for your job search?
