# Show HN: I built a mobile site for sharing Costco .97 clearance deals

**Posted by coolwulf on 2025-06-20**

Hey Costco lovers!

If you’re like me, you’ve probably noticed those legendary clearance deals at Costco ending in .97 — the ones that fly off the shelves and disappear before you know it.

So I built a mobile-first website: [https://97deal.shop](https://97deal.shop)

It’s a simple, community-powered app where people can:

- Snap and upload .97 price tags they find in-store (using AI to automatically generate the item number, title, and price)  
- Tag the location (Costco warehouse)  
- Search and browse recent deals near you  

The goal is to make it easy for all of us to share these hidden gems before they’re gone.

It’s still early days, and I’m open to feedback. Would love your thoughts or ideas!
