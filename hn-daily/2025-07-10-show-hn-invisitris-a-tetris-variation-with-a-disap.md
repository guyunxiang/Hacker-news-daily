# Show HN: Invisitris â€“ A Tetris variation with a disappearing grid

**Posted by eddguzzo on 2025-07-10**

I built Invisitris, a variation of Tetris where all but the last placed piece are invisible. The grid remains hidden most of the time, adding a new layer of challenge and deception. 

Periodically, the entire grid is revealed, either at random intervals or when you clear lines. This visibility toggle tests your memory and spatial awareness, making the classic game more dynamic and engaging.
