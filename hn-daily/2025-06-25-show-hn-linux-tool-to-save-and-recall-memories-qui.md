# Show HN: Linux tool to save and recall memories quickly

**Posted by ryusufe on 2025-06-25**

I've created a small Linux command-line tool that helps you quickly save and recall important snippets, such as passwords, commands, ideas, or anything you might want to note down.

It works by organizing your notes into files that serve as categories. Each category contains a list of memories, and each memory has associated keywords. When you need to find something, you can search by these keywords to quickly retrieve the relevant memory.

This project was developed for two reasons: 
1. To fulfill a personal need for a simple tool to remember Linux commands I rarely use.
2. As a learning project to improve my shell scripting skills without relying on third-party libraries, ensuring it works natively on most Linux distributions.

I'm open to contributions and welcome comments to improve the tool.
