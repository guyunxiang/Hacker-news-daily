# Probo vs. Vanta?

**Posted by aleksdahlberg on 2025-07-01**

We are deciding whether to renew Vanta or switch to Probo.

Probo (https://www.getprobo.com) has offered all the frameworks we need, including GDPR, HIPAA, SOC, and ISO. Their service is fully managed, covering not just initial setup but ongoing maintenance. They also handle engaging independent auditors at a startup-friendly, attractive price—at least, that’s what they’ve told us.

However, I’m struggling to find anyone who has used Probo to hear about their experience, so I’m hesitant to accept their offer. Given their YC background, I thought posting here might help.

Has anyone used Probo before? Additionally, has anyone switched from Vanta to Probo or vice versa?

This is not an endorsement for either platform. Compliance management tools tend to be cumbersome and expensive, often consuming significant resources beyond their high prices. I want to avoid making a poor decision here.

Thanks!
