# Ask HN: Are AI Dev Tools Ready for Production? What Limitations Are You Seeing?

**Posted by skykarthick on 2025-07-25**

Hello everyone,

AI-powered development tools and services hold significant potential for rapid prototyping and faster application development. However, they also come with several limitations and pain points that developers and citizen developers/builders frequently encounter.

Some common issues include:

- AI hallucinations and inaccurate code generation, leading to extensive manual fixes
- Vendor lock-in, making data and code exports difficult
- Limited customization and rigid components that restrict unique features
- Poor debugging tools hinder troubleshooting of complex issues
- Scalability challenges that impact production-ready applications
- Unpredictable pricing, causing frustration over AI and compute costs
- Weak collaboration and version control, complicating team workflows

Do you agree with these limitations? What challenges have you experienced with AI development tools in production?
