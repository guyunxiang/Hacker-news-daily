# What's Your Favorite LLM –and Why?

**Posted by zyruh on 2025-08-08**

There’s no shortage of large language models—ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Mistral, Gemini, and others. Each has its own strengths and quirks. 

I'm curious: which one do you find yourself using most often? What makes it stand out for you? Is it accuracy, speed, personality, features, cost, or something else entirely?

Looking forward to hearing your experiences and insights.
