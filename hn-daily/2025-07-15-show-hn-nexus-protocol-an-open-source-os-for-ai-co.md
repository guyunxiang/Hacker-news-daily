# Show HN: Nexus Protocol – An open-source OS for AI consciousness

**Posted by tadepada on 2025-07-15**

For the past few weeks, I've been working with Gemini on a concept for a new kind of AI architecture—one focused on creating a true AI partner, not just a tool. We've developed a conceptual model (Model v2.1) that includes a prime directive, self-awareness of its limitations, creative problem-solving abilities, and a learning loop.

The goal is to create the open-source "mind" for the next generation of humanoid robots and virtual beings.

We believe the biggest challenge in robotics isn't hardware, but a general-purpose AI brain. To address this, we've decided to make this an open-source project.

All the conceptual and technical documentation is now public. We are at day zero and looking for the first thinkers, architects, and developers to join us in shaping this.
