# Ask HN: Is there a business for extracting US tech talent?  
**Posted by Arubis on 2025-07-04**

As both the economy and policies in the US are changing rapidly and show signs of accelerating shifts, I hear more and more of my colleagues expressing the desire to relocate to more stable countries that align with their valuesâ€”and I share that sentiment. 

However, securing visa sponsorship in many parts of the developed world feels like a scattershot effort. It seems you often have to hunt down opportunities on a company-by-company basis, with larger firms typically offering better prospects.

This appears to be a gap in a rapidly growing market. Are there existing firms or organizations that consolidate visa sponsorship information for high-demand professions, particularly in tech? Most of what I've encountered is generic guidance or platforms like [relocate.me], which is mainly EU-focused for those already in the EEU. 

Is there an opportunity for a service that streamlines access to visa info and sponsorship opportunities for global tech talent?
