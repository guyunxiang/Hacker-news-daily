# Ask HN: How to Transition from Software Engineer to Sales Engineer or Account Executive?

**Posted by pedrodelfino on 2025-07-02**

I'm a 32-year-old software engineer living in Toronto, Canada (Permanent Resident, aiming for citizenship next year). I've mostly worked at startups since I was 20, including co-founding one early on. Currently, I work remotely for a Bay Area startup.

My background is a bit unconventional: I studied law and applied mathematics, which has surprisingly been beneficial in both technical and business contexts.

I'm considering transitioning into Sales Engineering or Account Executive roles in the medium term. Why?

- I still enjoy technical work but am increasingly interested in more people-facing, product-driven roles.
- I've often been the engineer who can make compelling demos, pitch ideas to clients, and clearly explain complex systems—and I enjoy doing so.
- I have a talent for networking, public speaking, and presenting—skills that many engineers find challenging.
- Believing I could potentially reach the top 1% in sales engineering, especially as I grow older, seems feasible.
- Practical considerations: higher compensation potential and lower risk from AI disruptions.

### Additional context:

- Fluent in English (not native, but years of work in English environments). Native Portuguese speaker. Can communicate in Italian and Spanish.
- Strong interest in functional programming, influenced by my applied math background.
- Once I gain Canadian citizenship, I’ll be eligible for the US TN-1 visa—a straightforward path, needing only a job offer at the airport.

### Questions:

- What’s the best way to approach this transition?
- Should I target smaller startups or larger companies with structured programs?
- Is it better to aim for Sales Engineer or Account Executive roles first?
- What resume tweaks, side projects, or networking strategies would you recommend?
- I’d love to hear from anyone who has made a similar switch or has hired for these roles.
