# Ask HN: Which OSS projects are openly accepting AI assisted code / bugfixes?

**Posted by devnonymous on 2025-07-24**

I'm curious if there are any large, popular open-source projects—comparable in scale to Django, Flask, or even larger—that have a clear policy regarding accepting AI-assisted code or bug fixes. Are maintainers openly welcoming submissions created with AI assistance, or are there guidelines around this?
