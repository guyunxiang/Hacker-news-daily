# Hetackling SAP Supply Chain Pain. Got Advice?

**Posted by Njord01 on 2025-07-02**

Hey folks,

We’re a small startup based in the UK, moving to San Francisco next month. Our focus is building smarter supply chain modules that address the real pain points in SAP environments—especially around public procurement, supplier risk scoring, tender analytics, and automated matching between vendors and government contracts.

We’re now transitioning toward integrating our solutions into SAP ecosystems, starting with Ariba and SRM-style modules. The challenge: SAP is massive, complex, and, to be honest, not always friendly to innovation.

Does anyone have experience with SAP integrations, procurement workflows, supplier risk engines, or tender-based sourcing strategies?  
We would love to hear your insights, warnings, success stories, or even just tips like “watch out for that edge case.”

Additionally, if you’ve ever hacked around SAP, seen homegrown fixes, or built tools that sit on top of it, we’re curious—how did you go about it?

Thanks in advance! We’re happy to share what we’ve learned too.
