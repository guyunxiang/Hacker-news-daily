# Show HN: Crop Images Instantly – No Upload Required

**Posted by devxiyang on 2025-08-01**

Hi HN,  
  
I built a tiny, ultra-fast image cropping tool — [cropimages.co](https://cropimages.co). It runs entirely in your browser, with no uploads, no tracking, and no watermark. Simply drag your image in, crop what you need, and download.

Why? I was tired of clunky online tools that load slowly and are filled with annoying ads. This tool loads instantly, works offline, and respects your privacy.

It's built with HTML and Canvas, making it ideal for quick edits without the need to open a large program like Photoshop.

Would love to hear your feedback!
