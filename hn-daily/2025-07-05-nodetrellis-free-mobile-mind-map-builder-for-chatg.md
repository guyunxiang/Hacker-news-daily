# NodeTrellis – free mobile mind-map builder for ChatGPT JSON

**Posted by Pyhelix on 2025-07-05**

Hi HN,

I built NodeTrellis, a lightweight web app that converts ChatGPT-generated JSON into an interactive mind map. It’s completely client-side—no log-ins, no servers, and entirely free.

## How it works

1. Enter a topic (or paste any URL) and click *Copy Prompt*.
2. Send that prompt to ChatGPT and copy the JSON it returns.
3. Paste the JSON into NodeTrellis and click *Render Map*.
4. Instantly, you get a draggable, zoomable mind map that you can edit, undo/redo, and export.

I’d love your feedback, bug reports, and feature ideas. Thanks for checking it out!
