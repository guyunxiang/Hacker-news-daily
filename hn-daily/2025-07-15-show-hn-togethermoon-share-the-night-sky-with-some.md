Ever been on a call with someone across the world and wished you could share a moment looking at the same physical thing? The Moon is the only object both of you can actually see together.

This tool uses real astronomical calculations to tell you when you and someone in another city can both see the Moon at the same time. It's perfect for long-distance relationships, late-night calls with friends abroad, or staying connected with family across time zones.

Try it now—London and Paris can both see the Moon tonight. Or test with any two cities worldwide. All calculations happen in your browser, so your shared moments stay private.
