# Show HN: Nexus.js - Fabric.js for 3D

**Posted by ges on 2025-06-16**

I was looking for a tiny library to easily transform both 2D and 3D objects with simple mouse or touch controls and a fixed camera in the browser.

Like a straightforward 3D editor but without requiring users to be Blender experts.

Since I couldn't find anything lightweight, I decided to build one. Think Fabric.js but for 3Dâ€”built entirely with Three.js and React Three Fiber (R3F).

I borrowed some inspiration from VR and AR interaction systems for the controls.

Feel free to try it out and let me know what you think!
