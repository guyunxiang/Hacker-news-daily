# Ask HN: What's your best workflows to draft legal agreements without lawyers?

**Posted by philippb on 2025-07-29**

I just received an outrageous bill from a lawyer for drafting an agreement. 

I'm wondering if anyone has an effective workflow for creating legal agreements using AI that are good enough for a lawyer to review, rather than having a lawyer draft from scratch.

My background is in computer science, so it's hard for me to evaluate the quality myself, and I feel that ChatGPT doesn't always provide enough detailed output.
