# Show HN: Tinykv – minimal file-backed key-value store for Rust

**Posted by hasanyildiz on 2025-07-04**

I built Tinykv because I kept reaching for simple persistent storage in Rust projects but found existing solutions either too complex (sled) or unmaintained (pickledb).

Tinykv focuses on simplicity: it’s JSON-based, serde-powered, with optional TTL. It’s perfect for CLI tools, game saves, and configuration storage.

Would appreciate any feedback from the HN community!
