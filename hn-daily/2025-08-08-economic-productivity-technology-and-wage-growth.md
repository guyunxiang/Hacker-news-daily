# Economic Productivity, Technology and Wage Growth

**Posted by morpheos137 on 2025-08-08**

Economics is a strange field claiming to be quantitative and scientific but often influenced by quasi-ideologies.

My higher education background is in Economics.

Traditionally, it’s believed that increasing technology and productivity boost economic output, leading to rising real wages over time as workers receive a larger share of a growing "pie." 

But what happens in a consumption-driven economy when technology and automation enable capital owners to capture an even larger share of the pie? To satisfy consumer demand, fewer people are needed in production per unit of output.

The usual answer is that the service economy expands. 

However, what if this also applies to services—like dog walking—that are increasingly provided by app-hawking mega-corporations such as Wag? 

Does a point come when an economy can meet demand logistically, but due to surpluses of workers and concentration of ownership, it cannot effectively distribute wealth through wage income? As a result, consumption stalls despite ample supply?

Additionally, what if most of our consumption goods are produced abroad, with our purchasing power maintained only by the waning strength of our currency?

I see several possible futures:

- **Democratic socialism with UBI based on local soviets**
- **Collapse into civil strife**
- **An unknown, unpredictable outcome**

The first scenario seems unlikely because society has largely bought into a transitional liberal capitalist system that only proved efficient during the 19th-century industrial revolution. Today, clickbait ads, YouTube videos on toenail fungus, nature documentaries, and Facebook likes cannot drive a robust economy.

I believe the most probable outcome is civil strife and war as the current system collapses under its own weight. Perhaps then, society might revert to rural agrarian communism or hunter-gatherer lifestyles—ways of living that provided contentment and peace for thousands of years.

What do you think?
