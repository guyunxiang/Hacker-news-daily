# Ask HN: What are your favorite open source AI agent implementations?

**Posted by kanodiaashu on 2025-07-18**

I'm not looking for frameworks. I want to explore actual implementations that are focused on either deep research or coding agents. 

Candidates that come to mind include:

- Gemini CLI  
- Codex  
- SmolAgents  

Would love to have a discussion thread on this.
