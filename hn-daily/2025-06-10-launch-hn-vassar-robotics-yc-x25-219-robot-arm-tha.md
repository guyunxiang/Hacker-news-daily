Hi HN — I’m Charles from Vassar Robotics ([vassarrobotics.com](https://vassarrobotics.com)) — not much there but you can order the robot at [our shop](https://shop.vassarrobotics.com/products/navrim-robot-that-learns-skills-in-30-minutes).

**Update:** The entire run sold out thanks to HN today—thank you all! Sorry to anyone who missed out. You can get in on the next batch here: [Newsletter Signup](https://vassarrobotics.com/newsletter).

## Introducing the $219 NavRim Robot Arm

We are launching an upgraded version of the beloved SO-101 robot arms, now available at a $219 price point. It features improved mechanical design and added intelligence. Check out what it can do here: [Demo Video](https://youtube.com/shorts/xNyPKJZI400) (note: demos are sped up).

## Background and Inspiration

I’ve spent years building RC planes ([hangar](https://cyo.ng/hangar)) and micro gas turbines ([MIT SET](https://set.mit.edu)), always wishing hardware was more affordable so more people could experiment. Now, I’m releasing a desktop robot arm kit that maintains the kinematics of LeRobot SO-101, replaces key parts with sturdier, more precise SLA 3D prints, and includes two integrated 480p cameras.

After negotiating with multiple suppliers, the entire kit costs less than just the twelve servos alone. The mechanical design will be released under an MIT license by June 30.

## Software and AI Integration

On the software front, I’ll also share an MIT-licensed MCP server by June 30. This exposes the robot’s local policy as tools usable by agentic LLMs (like Opus 4, o3), enabling long-horizon tasks.

**Here’s how it works:** Teach the robot new skills through teleoperation. During inference, users communicate with the agentic LLM via natural language. The LLM calls the local robot policy through MCP, decomposing high-level instructions into executable commands automatically.

## Feedback and Future Plans

I’d love to hear your feedback! Beyond manufacturing, I’m considering:

- A force-controlled gripper
- A parallel-jaw gripper
- An extra wrist degree of freedom (matching recent Trossen and ARX arms)
- Full force feedback on the main arm (though this could triple the cost)
- A more affordable version with lower joint resolution
- A longer-reach variant

Which of these features—or something else—would be most useful to you?
