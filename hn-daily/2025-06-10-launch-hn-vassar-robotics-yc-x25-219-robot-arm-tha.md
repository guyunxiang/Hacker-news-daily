# Launch HN: Vassar Robotics (YC X25) – $219 robot arm that learns new skills

**Posted by charleszyong on 2025-06-10**

Hi HN — I’m Charles from Vassar Robotics ([https://vassarrobotics.com/](https://vassarrobotics.com/)) — not much there yet, but you can order the robot at [https://shop.vassarrobotics.com/products/navrim-robot-that-learns-skills-in-30-minutes](https://shop.vassarrobotics.com/products/navrim-robot-that-learns-skills-in-30-minutes).

**Update:** The entire run sold out today thanks to HN—thank you all! Sorry to anyone who missed out. We’ll be adding options for preorders shortly.

## Introducing the Vassar Robotics $219 Robot Arm

We’re bringing an upgraded version of the beloved SO-101 robot arms to a $219 price point, featuring improved mechanical design and added intelligence.  
See it in action here: [https://youtube.com/shorts/xNyPKJZI400](https://youtube.com/shorts/xNyPKJZI400) *(demos are sped up)*

## Background and Inspiration

I’ve spent years building RC planes ([https://cyo.ng/hangar/](https://cyo.ng/hangar/)) and micro gas turbines ([https://set.mit.edu](https://set.mit.edu)). I’ve always wished hardware was more affordable so more people could experiment and innovate.

## What We're Launching

- A desktop robot arm kit that keeps the kinematics of LeRobot SO-101.
- Replaces key parts with sturdier, more precise SLA 3D prints.
- Adds two integrated 480p cameras.
- The entire kit costs less than just the twelve servos it uses.

We plan to release the updated mechanical design under an MIT license by June 30.

## Software and Integration

Alongside hardware, I’ll also release an MIT-licensed MCP server by June 30. This exposes the robot's local policy as tools for agentic LLMs (like Opus 4, o3, etc.) to perform long-horizon tasks.

**How it works:**  
You can teach the robot new skills via teleoperation. During inference, communicate with an agentic LLM using natural language. The LLM calls the local robot policy through MCP, automatically translating your high-level instructions into executable robot commands.

## Community and Feedback

Big thanks to the LeRobot community for helping make such an accessible robot! If you’ve contributed to the LeRobot GitHub repo, email hello@vassarrobotics.com for a 20% discount coupon as a small token of appreciation.

I’d love your feedback! Beyond manufacturing, I’m considering:
- Adding a force-controlled gripper
- A parallel-jaw gripper
- An extra wrist degree of freedom (matching new Trossen and ARX arms)
- Full force feedback on the main arm (though that might triple the price)
- A more affordable version with lower joint resolution
- A longer-reach variant

Which of these—or something else—would be most useful to you?

## Ordering and Shipping

You can order the robot here: [https://shop.vassarrobotics.com/products/navrim-robot-that-learns-skills-in-30-minutes](https://shop.vassarrobotics.com/products/navrim-robot-that-learns-skills-in-30-minutes).  

**Note:** The initial batch of 20 units, to be shipped by June 30, is sold out. We have a second batch of 100 units, with unassembled kits shipping by July 15 and assembled units by July 21. The order limit helps us maintain quality and meet deadlines.

For those who already ordered, I will reach out individually to offer weekly progress updates until your robot ships.
