# Launch HN: Vassar Robotics (YC X25) – $219 robot arm that learns new skills

**Posted by charleszyong on 2025-06-10**

Hi HN — I’m Charles from Vassar Robotics ([vassarrobotics.com](https://vassarrobotics.com)) — not much there yet, but you can order the robot at [our shop](https://shop.vassarrobotics.com/products/navrim-robot-that-learns-skills-in-30-minutes).

**Update:** The entire run sold out today thanks to HN—thank you all! Sorry to anyone who missed out. We’ll add a preordering option soon.

We're launching an upgraded version of the beloved SO-101 robot arms at a $219 price point, featuring improved mechanical design and added intelligence.

**See what it can do:** [YouTube demo](https://youtube.com/shorts/xNyPKJZI400)  
*(Note: demos are sped up as shown in the video)*

**Background:**  
I’ve spent years building RC planes ([hangar](https://cyo.ng/hangar/)) and micro gas turbines ([MIT SET](https://set.mit.edu)). I’ve always wished hardware was more affordable so more people could experiment.

**The product:**  
A $219 desktop robot-arm kit inspired by LeRobot SO-101, with key upgrades:  
- Same kinematics  
- More precise, sturdy parts made with SLA printing  
- Two integrated 480p cameras

After negotiating with suppliers, the entire kit costs less than the twelve servos alone. I plan to release the updated mechanical design under an MIT license by June 30.

**Software & Integration:**  
I’ll also release an MIT-licensed MCP server by June 30. This server exposes the robot’s local policy as tools for agentic LLMs (like Opus 4, o3) to perform long-horizon tasks.

**How it works:**  
- Teach the robot new skills via teleoperation.  
- During inference, converse with the LLM using natural language.  
- The LLM calls the local robot policy through MCP, automatically translating high-level instructions into executable commands.

Thanks to the LeRobot community for making such a capable robot accessible. If you’ve contributed to the LeRobot GitHub repo, email hello@vassarrobotics.com for a 20% discount coupon as a token of appreciation.

**We'd love your feedback!**  
Beyond manufacturing, we're considering:  
- A force-controlled gripper  
- A parallel-jaw gripper  
- An extra wrist degree of freedom (matching newer arms from Trossen and ARX)  
- Full force feedback on the main arm (though that might triple the cost)  
- A more affordable lower-resolution version for each joint  
- A longer-reach variant

Which features or ideas do you find most useful? Let us know!
