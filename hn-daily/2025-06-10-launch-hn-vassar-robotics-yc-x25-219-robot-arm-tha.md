# Launch HN: Vassar Robotics (YC X25) – $219 robot arm that learns new skills

**Posted by charleszyong on 2025-06-10**

Hi HN — I’m Charles from Vassar Robotics ([vassarrobotics.com](https://vassarrobotics.com)). Not much there yet, but you can order the robot at [shop.vassarrobotics.com](https://shop.vassarrobotics.com/products/navrim-robot-that-learns-skills-in-30-minutes).

**Edit:** The entire run sold out today thanks to HN—thank you all! Sorry to anyone who missed out. You can join the next batch here: [vassarrobotics.com/newsletter](https://vassarrobotics.com/newsletter).

## Introducing the Vassar Robotic Arm: $219, Learns New Skills

We’re bringing an upgraded version of the long-beloved SO-101 robot arm to a $219 price point, featuring improved mechanical design and added intelligence. Check out what it can do in this demo: [YouTube Shorts](https://youtube.com/shorts/xNyPKJZI400) (note: demo is sped up).

## Background & Inspiration

I’ve spent years developing RC planes ([cyo.ng/hangar](https://cyo.ng/hangar)) and micro gas turbines ([MIT SET](https://set.mit.edu)). I’ve always wished hardware was more affordable so anyone could experiment.

Now, I’m launching a desktop robot-arm kit that:

- Keeps the kinematics of LeRobot SO-101
- Replaces key parts with sturdier, more precise SLA 3D prints
- Adds two integrated 480p cameras

After negotiating with suppliers, the full kit costs less than just the twelve servos inside. The mechanical design will be released under an MIT license by June 30.

## Software & AI Integration

On the software side, I’ll release an MIT-licensed MCP server by June 30. This server exposes the robot’s policies as tools for agentic LLMs (**Opus 4, o3**, etc.) to use in complex, long-term tasks.

**Here’s how it works:**  
You teach the robot new skills via teleoperation. During inference, you give natural language commands to the LLM, which decomposes high-level requests into executable robot actions through MCP.

## Feedback & Future Plans

I’d love to hear your thoughts! Besides manufacturing, I’m considering:

- A force-controlled gripper
- A parallel-jaw gripper
- An extra wrist degree of freedom (matching the latest Trossen and ARX arms)
- Full force feedback on the main arm (though that might triple the price)
- More affordable versions with lower joint resolution
- Longer-reach variants

Which features would be most useful to you? Or suggest something else!

## Ordering & Availability

You can order the current version here: [shop.vassarrobotics.com](https://shop.vassarrobotics.com/products/navrim-robot-that-learns-skills-in-30-minutes).  

**Note:** The first batch of 20 units, shipping by June 30, is sold out.  
The second batch of 100 units will ship by **July 15** (unassembled kits) and **July 21** (assembled units). We limit orders to maintain quality and timely shipment.

For those who already ordered, I’ll contact you individually for weekly updates until your robot ships.
