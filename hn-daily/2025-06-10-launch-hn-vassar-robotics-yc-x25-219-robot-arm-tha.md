# Launch HN: Vassar Robotics (YC X25) – $219 robot arm that learns new skills

**Posted by charleszyong on 2025-06-10**

Hi HN — I’m Charles from Vassar Robotics ([vassarrobotics.com](https://vassarrobotics.com)) — not much there yet, but you can order the robot at [shop.vassarrobotics.com](https://shop.vassarrobotics.com/products/navrim-robot-that-learns-skills-in-30-minutes).

**Update:** The entire run sold out today—thank you all! Sorry to anyone who missed out. We’ll be adding a pre-order option shortly.

We are launching an upgraded version of the beloved SO-101 robot arm at a $219 price point, featuring improved mechanical design and added intelligence. See it in action here: [YouTube Shorts](https://youtube.com/shorts/xNyPKJZI400) (demos are sped up in the video).

After years of building RC planes ([cyo.ng/hangar](https://cyo.ng/hangar)) and micro gas turbines ([set.mit.edu](https://set.mit.edu)), I’ve always wished hardware was more affordable for wider experimentation.

Now, I’m introducing a $219 desktop robot-arm kit that retains the kinematics of LeRobot SO-101, with sturdier, more precise SLA-printed parts, and two integrated 480p cameras. After negotiating with suppliers, the entire kit costs less than just the twelve servos alone. The updated mechanical design will be released under an MIT license by June 30.

**Software plans:** I’ll also release an MIT-licensed MCP server by June 30, which exposes the robot's local policy as tools for agentic LLMs (like Opus 4, o3, etc.) to handle long-horizon tasks. Here’s how it works:

- Teach the robot new skills through teleoperation.
- During inference, the user communicates with an AI agent via natural language.
- The AI calls the local robot policy through MCP, decomposing high-level requests into executable commands automatically.

Thanks to the LeRobot community for making such accessible robotics possible. If you contributed to the LeRobot GitHub repo, email hello@vassarrobotics.com for a 20% discount coupon — a small thank-you!

I’d love your feedback! Beyond improving manufacturing, cleaning up the code, and writing docs, I’m considering:

- A force-controlled gripper
- A parallel-jaw gripper
- An extra wrist degree of freedom (matching new Trossen and ARX arms)
- Full force feedback on the main arm (may triple the price)
- A lower-resolution, more affordable version with fewer joints
- A longer-reach variant

Which features or ideas would be most useful to you?
