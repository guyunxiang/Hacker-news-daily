# Launch HN: Vassar Robotics (YC X25) – $219 robot arm that learns new skills

**Posted by charleszyong on 2025-06-10**

Hi HN — I’m Charles from Vassar Robotics ([vassarrobotics.com](https://vassarrobotics.com/)). Not much there yet, but you can order the robot at [our shop](https://shop.vassarrobotics.com/products/navrim-robot-that-learns-skills-in-30-minutes).

**Update:** The entire run sold out thanks to HN today—thank you all! Sorry to anyone who missed out. We’ll add an option for preorders shortly.

## About the New Robot Arm

We’re launching an upgraded version of the beloved SO-101 robot arms, now priced at $219, with improved mechanical design and added intelligence. 

Check out what it can do: [YouTube Demo](https://youtube.com/shorts/xNyPKJZI400) (note: demos are sped-up).

## Background & Motivation

I’ve spent years building RC planes ([hangar](https://cyo.ng/hangar/)) and micro gas turbines ([MIT SET](https://set.mit.edu)), always wishing hardware would be more affordable so more people could experiment.

Now, I’m releasing a desktop robot-arm kit that:

- Maintains LeRobot SO-101’s kinematics
- Replaces key parts with sturdier, more precise SLA-printed components
- Integrates two 480p cameras

After negotiating with suppliers, the entire kit costs less than just the twelve servos it uses. I also plan to release the mechanical design under an MIT license by June 30.

## Software & Integration

Alongside the hardware, I’ll release an MIT-licensed MCP server by June 30. This server exposes the robot’s policy as tools for agentic LLMs (like Opus 4, O3). 

**How it works:**

1. Teach the robot new skills through teleoperation.
2. During inference, communicate with an LLM via natural language.
3. The LLM uses MCP to decompose your requests into executable robot commands automatically.

## Community & Feedback

Thanks to the LeRobot community for making such advanced hardware accessible. If you’ve contributed to the LeRobot GitHub repo, email hello@vassarrobotics.com for a 20% discount coupon as a token of appreciation.

I’d love your feedback on future features, such as:

- Force-controlled or parallel-jaw grippers
- An extra wrist degree of freedom (matching new arms like Trossen and ARX)
- Full force feedback (though that might triple the cost)
- A more affordable lower-resolution joint version
- A longer-reach variant

Which of these, or something else, would be most useful to you?

## Ordering & Shipping

You can order the robot here: [Order Link](https://shop.vassarrobotics.com/products/navrim-robot-that-learns-skills-in-30-minutes).

**Note:** It’s currently sold out, but we’ll be adding pre-order options soon. We hope to earn your business in the future.

**Shipping schedule (as per our shop page):**
- The first batch of 20 units, shipping by June 30, is sold out.
- The second batch of 100 units will be shipped by July 15 (unassembled kits) and July 21 (assembled units).

For those who have already ordered, I will reach out individually to offer weekly progress updates until shipping.
