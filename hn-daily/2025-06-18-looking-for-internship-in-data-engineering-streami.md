# Looking for: Internship in Data Engineering, Streaming Systems, or Infrastructure

**Posted by pirimi on 2025-06-18**

I'm currently seeking an internship opportunity in data engineering, streaming systems, or infrastructure.

**Skills and Experience:**
- Technologies: Apache Flink, Kafka, Spark, Hadoop, Spring Boot, AWS, C++, FastAPI, Java, MongoDB, Postgres, ML, DL
- Additional: Pricing options knowledge

I've developed a real-time portfolio optimization system that streams stock and index data from the Casablanca exchange through Kafka into Flink. The system calculates log returns and dynamically updates portfolio weights using Markowitz/APT models. It handles deduplication, uses RocksDB for state management, and deploys components across both local and cloud environments, including a hybrid Hadoop cluster.

Additionally, I built a chatbot for the Moroccan government utilizing RAG, FAISS, CamemBERT, and FastAPI, deployed on Ubuntu with frontend integration via Drupal.

I'm eager to contribute to serious teams working on infrastructure, trading systems, or scalable backend solutions.
