# People can exploit your social media pictures and so I've made a tool

**Posted by Gravyt1 on 2025-08-06**

I've been working on a simple but useful website for a few weeks now, designed to be accessible to everyone. The project is of good quality, which has helped me better understand how to gain visibility for a bootstrapped project I created.

This site isn't revolutionary—most of the front-end code is written by me, with some AI assistance. Its primary purpose is to bring together several privacy protection tools. Currently, it includes a tool for viewing and deleting metadata from various document types.

**Why is this important?**  
Many people are unaware that files shared online can contain sensitive information:  
- **Photos:** GPS location, date, device model  
- **Documents:** Author's name, editing history, comments  

These data points can be exploited for OSINT, tracking habits, feeding AI models, or even identity theft.

Unlike some tools, this site does not store any files. I plan to make the source code available or eventually develop a front-end-only version. For now, everything is processed server-side using Python Pillow and is immediately returned without saving backups. All data is kept in temporary variables and cleared after processing.

**Future plans include:**  
- Adding a lightweight API  
- Incorporating other privacy tools  
- Creating educational content about digital privacy

I'm currently looking for more users to try the website and would appreciate contributors. I have created a Product Hunt page for this project—if you like the idea, please test the site or upvote this post!

Thank you!
