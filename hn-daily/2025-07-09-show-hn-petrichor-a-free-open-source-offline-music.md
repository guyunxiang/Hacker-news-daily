# Show HN: Petrichor â€“ a free, open-source, offline music player for macOS

**Posted by kushalpandya on 2025-07-09**

I have a large collection of music files gathered over the years, so I was sorely missing a decent offline music player that can serve as a frontend for the collection. I tried several Mac apps over the years, but since streaming music is mainstream now, there aren't good offline music players that meet my needs. 

So I spent the last 3 months building Petrichor! The goal was to solve my problem while learning Swift UI development, and to give back to the community with this open-source project.

### Features (with more coming in future updates):

- Everything you'd expect from an offline music player  
- Map your music folders and browse your library in an organized view  
- Create playlists and manage the play queue interactively  
- Browse music using folder view when needed  
- Pin almost anything to the sidebar for quick access to your favorites  
- Navigate easily: right-click a track to go to its album, artist, year, etc.  
- Native macOS integration with menubar and dock playback controls, plus dark mode support  
- Search quickly through large libraries containing thousands of songs  

The app is still in alpha, so it may look unpolished, but I've been testing the builds over the past few weeks and fixing issues for the upcoming v1 release. 

I welcome any feedback and contributions! Feel free to check out the GitHub repo, try it out, and let me know what you think.
