# Ask HN: Any tool that can auto instrument code and serve as a debugging copilot

**Posted by gritlin on 2025-07-08**

I'm looking for a tool that can automatically instrument my front-end and back-end code (React, Python, and .NET), send logs to a centralized location, and assist me in debugging when a customer reports an issue—basically, a debugging copilot. 

If such a tool doesn't exist, what’s the closest alternative?
