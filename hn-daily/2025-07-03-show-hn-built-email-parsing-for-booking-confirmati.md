# Show HN: Built email parsing for booking confirmations for my travel app – Aruko

**Posted by ankit21j on 2025-07-03**

A few months ago, I shared my travel app here. Today, I’m back with a solution to a real technical challenge I faced: parsing booking confirmation emails accurately.

**The problem:**  
Parsing booking confirmation emails in a way that reliably extracts all relevant information.

**The solution:**  
I built a parsing system that:

- Distinguishes between connection hubs and actual destinations  
- Captures all segments (flights, hotels, trains) in the correct order  
- Handles different email formats across various booking sites  
- Creates complete, automated itineraries  

Happy to discuss more if anyone's interested!
