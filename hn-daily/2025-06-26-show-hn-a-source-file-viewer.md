# Show HN: A Source File Viewer

**Posted by rwallace on 2025-06-26**

Hitherto, like probably most people, I had been viewing source code in the same programs in which I wrote itâ€”mostly Notepad++ or VS Code. I decided that reading code is an important enough use case to justify a dedicated program designed to do it better.

This project also served as a test case for Claude Code. It performed well. However, there are some challenges this project did not test. In particular, good performance when writing a small program from scratch does not necessarily translate to how well it will handle large existing codebases.
