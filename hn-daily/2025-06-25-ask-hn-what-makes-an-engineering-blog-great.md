# Ask HN: What makes an engineering blog great?

**Posted by andrewstetsenko on 2025-06-25**

According to Stack Overflow’s annual surveys, about 1 in 3 developers consider company-owned content—like engineering blogs—as one of their top three ways to discover potential employers, alongside personal networks and company reviews.

This got me thinking about what truly makes a great engineering blog. Here are some patterns I've noticed—would love to hear your thoughts:

## 1. Transparency Draws Talent  
The best engineering blogs don’t just explain what the company is working on; they offer a candid view into real challenges, trade-offs, and the team’s thinking process. For potential hires, this transparency signals technical depth and a healthy culture.

## 2. Credit Where It’s Due  
Companies like Netflix excel at this—they not only share technical content but also spotlight individual contributors. Recognizing team members builds morale internally and demonstrates the caliber of talent behind the work externally.

## 3. Distribution Matters  
A well-written post can go unnoticed without internal support. When engineers share their own content—or promote each other—it creates a feedback loop: increased reach, recognition, and a boost to the company's reputation.

## 4. The Shift from Medium  
A few years ago, Medium was the go-to platform for tech org blogs. Recently, there’s been a quiet move back to hosting content on company-owned domains—likely for better SEO, more control over analytics, and long-term ownership.

## 5. Substack? Not (Yet) Mainstream  
I expected Substack would become popular among engineering blogs, but it's not widely adopted yet. A few examples like PostHog and Jam.dev stand out, but overall, it’s still rare. Curious if anyone has thoughts or other examples.

## 6. Write for Developers  
Content that resonates generally teaches something useful, rather than just showcasing the stack. Code snippets, TL;DR summaries, actionable insights—these tend to be more engaging than generic case studies or product updates.

**Tip:** Testing draft blog posts on Hacker News can be a great way to gather early feedback and see if the content interests the broader developer community.
