# Show HN: I built a mindmap-like, non-linear tutor-supported interface for papers

**Posted by kanodiaashu on 2025-07-04**

Hi everyone,

LLMs have made me feel like I can understand anything, but I’ve been frustrated trying to truly understand ML papers using just ChatGPT or static PDFs. Summaries help, but then I have to go back to the paper and read it linearly to deepen my understanding. I also find it hard to keep track of long ChatGPT conversations.

To address this, I built an interface designed for non-linear, brain-like exploration of papers—paired with a tutor in a chat interface that guides your understanding.

### Features:

- **Knowledge maps**: Visualize how ideas within a paper relate to each other and how different papers connect across a field. You can start with curated maps of foundational LLM papers or build your own for any paper or set of papers you're reading. You can even listen to the map as a podcast.

- **Interactive tutoring**: A chat-based tutor like ChatGPT helps answer your questions while simultaneously updating the knowledge map, ensuring you don't lose track of the bigger picture.

- **Editable notebooks**: The map itself functions as a note-taking space where you can jot down notes, mark concepts as completed, tag concepts, and construct your own mental model as you read.

- **Deep dives**: Not only can you view summaries, but you can also drill down into source content—whether in readers for specific sections or through the original PDFs, text files, HTML, or URLs.

- **Personalized workspace**: You can create your own space with your papers and documents, allowing for interactive maps tailored to your research or study needs.

### The goal:

To move beyond linear reading or static summaries, creating a dynamic space where understanding evolves naturally—much like your own thinking—with a tutor helping you make sense of complex topics.

I'm seeking feedback from researchers and paper readers: Would this non-linear, guided exploration help you understand difficult topics or papers better than traditional PDFs or chat tools? What's missing or unclear?

Thanks!
