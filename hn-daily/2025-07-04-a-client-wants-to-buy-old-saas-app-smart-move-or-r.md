# A client wants to buy old SaaS app – smart move or risk?  
**Posted by AbbeyRoadRunner on 2025-07-04**

We’re a small software house that’s been developing a niche SaaS platform for cultural events over the past 15 years. The product works well, but we’re considering a rebuild for the coming year.

Recently, a well-known national retail brand approached us. They run a medium-sized cultural festival annually in their home country as part of their PR strategy. They want to use our platform but are explicitly against licensing. Their past experiences with vendors—either price hikes or vendors disappearing—have left them wary.

We’re currently in a bidding process alongside other companies. Most competitors seem to be either:

- Building something from scratch, or  
- White-labeling previous projects for similar events.  

We estimate that creating a new event app from scratch would cost around $60,000.

Our options so far are:

### 1. Provide a snapshot of our current codebase with no support, onboarding, or guarantees.
This isn’t ideal— they would need to hire someone to understand the architecture and logic before customizing or implementing it. It’s slow and inefficient, especially since we know the product inside-out.

### 2. Share the code and charge separately for the requested features not yet supported.
Our estimate for developing these features externally ranges from $13,500 (optimistic) to $38,000 (pessimistic).

### 3. Provide the code in escrow with a law firm of their choice.
If we go out of business or suddenly triple our rates to lock them in, they could release the source and continue working with another vendor. This offers peace of mind without transferring full ownership upfront.
