# Ask HN: Is "messaging systems specialist" a real job title or niche?

**Posted by pella_may on 2025-08-01**

I'm curious whether "messaging systems specialist" is an actual job title that companies hire for, or if it's typically just part of a broader role such as backend developer, DevOps engineer, or platform engineer.

Has anyone here worked in roles primarily focused on messaging systems like Kafka, RabbitMQ, Pulsar, NATS, or similar technologies? I find the topic fascinating, but I'm wondering if specializing in this area is a viable niche, or if it's better to stay more general as part of platform, backend, or cloud work.
