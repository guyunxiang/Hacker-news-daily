# Show HN: Joyspace AI Clips – Automatically Create Short Clips from Long Videos

**Posted by joyspace on 2025-06-25**

Hi HN,

Sagar here from Joyspace AI. We’ve built a video understanding model that works alongside transcripts to deeply comprehend people, objects, themes, personas, and the core message of a video.

Using this model as a foundation, we’ve launched Joyspace AI Clips. It automatically creates short, shareable clips from longer videos such as webinars, podcasts, talks, sales calls, Zoom recordings, and more. Our initial testing indicates higher accuracy in capturing all key moments from lengthy videos.

Currently, our model performs best when there's at least some human presence in the video. It doesn’t need to be every frame, but having a person in the scene significantly boosts accuracy. We plan to update the model to better handle categories like gaming videos or faceless content. While these still work today, the accuracy may be lower.

Joyspace AI Clips works particularly well with presentation-style content. From our observations, horizontal videos tend to perform better on social platforms when they include a presentation, while vertical videos are more effective for person-centric, face-to-camera formats.

All AI features are currently free as we work out pricing details. Our goal is to keep video transformation accessible and affordable.

We’d love for you to try it out and share your feedback—be it technical, product-related, or simply your impressions. Your input will help us improve.
