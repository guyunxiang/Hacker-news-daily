# Show HN: Medici, an open-source Splitwise-like app for managing expenses

**Posted by mrkaye97 on 2025-07-31**

Hey everyone!  

I've been working on this little app called Medici, named after my frustration with Splitwise limiting me to submitting only a few expenses per day. Medici includes all the main features of Splitwiseâ€”debt simplification, various expense split options, default splits, and more.

I'd love to get your feedback. I'm self-hosting it on my Raspberry Pi and thought others might find it useful too!
