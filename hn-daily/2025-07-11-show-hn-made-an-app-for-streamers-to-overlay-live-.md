# Show HN: Made an app for streamers to overlay live Telemetry for Bambu printers

**Posted by JoeOfTexas on 2025-07-11**

I've developed an application that works with my P1S printer, but I could use help testing it on other models.

I'm looking for a designer to help make the stream overlay look sleek and professional.

For those who don't have Python set up, don't worryâ€”I've made a zip file that includes a Windows executable (`app.exe`) to run the app easily.

Inside the `/static` folder, you'll find the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that allow you to customize the look and feel of the overlay.

The Python app runs a webserver with WebSockets to share live telemetry data from the printer to your browser, enabling real-time overlays for streaming.
