# Ask HN: Is ageism in tech still a problem?  
**Posted by leonagano on 2025-06-13**

It's been a while since I last addressed this topic. Six years ago, I launched a job board aimed at fighting ageism in tech. It received a lot of upvotes and comments, but it didn't generate any revenueâ€”made $0.

This still seems to be an ongoing problem. What do you think is the solution?
