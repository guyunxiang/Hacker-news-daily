# Ask HN: What Interests You in Crypto?

**Posted by bix6 on 2025-07-30**

I searched for crypto on HN, but most discussions focus on scams and thefts. While I understand those concerns, I’d love to hear what topics in crypto are currently exciting to you.

For example:
- What do you think about Bitcoin’s security? Will it ever be "hacked"?
- Do you believe Bitcoin will continue to rise as a global currency?
- What are your thoughts on newer solutions like Solana or Sui? Could they potentially replace Ethereum as the second most popular blockchain?
- Will real-world assets be meaningfully tokenized in the near future?
- Do you think every bank will have its own blockchain or stablecoin?
- Are there any projects or chains you’re actively working on?

Looking forward to your insights!
