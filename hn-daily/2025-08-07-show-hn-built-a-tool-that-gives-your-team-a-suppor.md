# Show HN: Built a tool that gives your team a support community in seconds

**Posted by connorjchen on 2025-08-07**

Hi HN! I’m Connor, and I’ve worked on a bunch of devtools over the years.

One pattern kept coming up: support is always a mess.

Questions are scattered across GitHub Issues, Discord, Slack threads, and emails. Docs can help, but only if people want to read them—which they usually don’t. Many teams end up wasting time answering the same questions repeatedly, or worse, get no signal at all because users silently churn or bounce.

Companies like Railway and Framer have built great internal systems for support, but most lean teams don’t have the time to create or maintain such tools.

To address this, I built **Paladin** — a beautiful, out-of-the-box, free, AI-driven support community that can be set up in seconds.

### What It Is:
- A shared space for roadmap updates, questions, and feedback (public or private)
- An AI support bot trained on your docs, playbooks, and past responses

### Coming Soon:
- AI-powered insights to help you understand what users are really asking for
- AI moderation that flags issues without over-policing—keeping the community safe while encouraging genuine discussion
- Discord integration that pulls relevant messages and support threads from your existing community, so questions and tickets don’t get lost

Paladin is designed to be the support platform you’d build yourself—ready to go instantly. If you’re working on a product and curious about how this could work for your team, you can spin it up in seconds [here].

I’d love your feedback! Drop a comment here or join the Paladin support community. Thanks for reading!
