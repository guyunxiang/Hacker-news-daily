# Show HN: Read Faster with LLMs

**Posted by Jsuh on 2025-07-31**

Hey HN. We’re two friends who love reading. We have an enormous backlog of books, blogs, and research papers but often lack the domain expertise and time to get through it all.

So we built Bitter, an AI reader designed to help us quickly understand complex books and papers. It’s incredibly useful for skimming long texts and then diving deep into the sections that seem especially interesting.

Currently, Bitter allows you to:
- Upload a PDF or add any webpage/PDF via a URL
- Highlight text for instant explanations
- Click on section headers to get quick summaries

Instead of a chat interface, the focus is on content. The AI is integrated in more ambient ways. We’re more interested in “AI helping me as I read” rather than “AI reading for me.”

We’d love for you to try it out at [readbitter.com](https://readbitter.com).
