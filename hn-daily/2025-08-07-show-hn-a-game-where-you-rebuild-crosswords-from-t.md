# Show HN: A game where you rebuild crosswords from tiles (Demo)

**Posted by Paul_Hebert on 2025-08-07**

Hey HN!  

I've been building a little web-based word game in my free time and would really appreciate your feedback!  

Right now, I have a demo of the core functionality for folks to play. I'm eager to gauge whether people are interested and what could make the game more fun. For example, should I introduce daily challenges or provide a fixed set of challenges?

I'd really appreciate your feedback! Thanks!  

P.S. I put together a short survey with specific questions, but any and all feedback is welcome: [Survey Link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1mv8p0ctr5QOpC0iJSB6XHnGYF9KUrrIwEybI42SuLno/edit)
