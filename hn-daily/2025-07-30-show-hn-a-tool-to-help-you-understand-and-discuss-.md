# Show HN: A tool to help you understand and discuss *Meditations* (Marcus Aurelius)

**Posted by huttiepant on 2025-07-30**

Genuine question: I often grapple with whether apps can help people think more critically. Now that AI can handle much of my thinking (perhaps too much, unfortunately), I’m exploring ways to stay sharp.

I built this tool for myself to better understand *Meditations* and to connect with others interested in discussing its big ideas. (My social status dropped quickly when I tried to bring up *Meditations* at a party.) Essentially, it offers end-of-chapter prompts and questions designed for open discussion.

Initially, I used ChatGPT to generate these questions, but I found they rarely went beyond a superficial level. So I reached out to philosophy professors who specialize in the book. They helped me think differently and craft better prompts and questions.

I’d love to discuss this with anyone interested in reading philosophy books (including *Meditations* and others). I believe more dialogue around these ideas is needed.

**P.P.S.** I previously launched a single-player version of this tool. I’ve since added discussion features and more. [See related discussion here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43571867).
