# Show HN: Built a simple colour palette generator – would love feedback

Hey everyone,

A bit of background:

A colleague of mine (UI/UX designer) mentioned she uses ChatGPT to help generate a color palette of tints and shades based on a base hex color. She then copies these suggestions into Figma to create a palette that fits her design.

However, she faced a few issues:
- ChatGPT was inconsistent or didn’t always produce what she wanted.
- It didn’t always display the hex codes, so she used an additional tool like Cooler.
- Relying on AI for color suggestions sometimes took away her focus on the design, and she preferred to make the choices herself.

To address this, I built a small tool that aims to simplify the process:

- Input a base color (or generate one randomly).
- Auto-generate tints (in 5% steps) and shades (in 10% steps), with adjustable options.
- Two modes: generate a complete palette or create a custom one.
- Easily copy the output to paste into Figma or other design tools.

There are no promotions or paid plans — it’s a free tool you can use without signing up. If you'd like to save a palette to your library, you can sign up for free.

I’d love honest feedback on:
- The usefulness of this workflow.
- UX and usability thoughts.
- Any features you think are missing.
