# Show HN: Py_better_exchook: intelligently print variables in stack traces

**Posted by albertzeyer on 2025-06-18**

Hi HN,

Py_better_exchook is a Python library that enhances exception handling by intelligently printing variables in stack traces.

I believe this project deserves more visibility compared to some similar tools out there.

In recent updates, I've added features to skip over certain types of variables to reduce verbosity. Additionally, support for f-strings has been integrated.

Feedback is very welcome!
